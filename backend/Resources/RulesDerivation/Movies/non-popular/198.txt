Film is still young enough for there to be credible arguments aboutjust what it is.Its entirely possible for someone to believe it is about whatphotography is, what the majority of us think photography is.Here's a photographer, and he believes that. His photographs evokeremembrances of an innocent sexuality, false memories certainly butsweet smelling. There's a deliberate unreality in the photos, withgirls in nearly surreal poses with the lens gauzed as if there were abarrier of sorts between our reality and that we see Â— or is itimagine?There's all sorts of implied narrative in these still photos. They areso, so very rich in what they imply.Now to film. I've seem "Laura," which was successful in a minor waybecause the artist dreaming about the new woman was placed in the storyexplicitly. Oh and he has vision problems, and he needs to translatehis story by shifting senses (to touch) just as we do from photo tomovie.This is his next project. I really don't know what he was thinking.Before he had sexual imaginings, here he simply has sex. Before hefocused on a wonderful symmetry: our imaginations of a young girlbalanced with her imaginings of an older man. I guess he thought hecould work a similar symmetry here with a young boy instead of theolder artist. But it fails in an extraordinarily large way.I think that is because in this case he invested too much in the story,the power of the story to carry the thing, and he drifted too far awayfrom where he has power, the image. I think "Walkabout" successfullydoes what this attempts. Go there instead.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do withthis part of your life.
