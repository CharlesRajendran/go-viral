Bugs Bunny is caught stealing carrots from the King's carrot patch bythe Sheriff of Nottingham. Classic short directed by Chuck Jones with astory by Michael Maltese. This one's lots of fun. Beautifully animatedwith well-drawn character and backgrounds. The lovely Technicolor isalways a plus. Great voice work the incomparable Mel Blanc as Bugs, theSheriff, and the dimwitted Little John who has a funny recurring bit.Rousing score from Carl W. Stalling. Lots of great gags and lines. Twoof my favorites are the real estate scam and the classic knighting gag.The Errol Flynn cameo at the end (via footage from a certain movie thatshould be too obvious for me to bother naming) always brings a smile tomy face.
