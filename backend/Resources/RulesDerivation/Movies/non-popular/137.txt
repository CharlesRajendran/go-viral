Young New York City surgeon, and amateur pilot, John Beal (as JamesStanton) rubs the older doctors at "General Hospital" the wrong way.Most of all, they consider his interest in flying an inappropriatehobby. After Mr. Beal gives the wife of another doctor a lift in hisplane, it crashes; and, the young woman dies. The accident becomes anational scandal, with the unwed Beal becoming romantically linked withhis married passenger. After being put on probation, Beal gives up hisprivileged life, hitchhikes to California, and becomes a hobo. He isrecognized by pilot friend Philip Huston (as Dick Miller), who helpsBeal get back up on his feet. Then, Mr. Huston, and pretty blonde nurseJoan Fontaine (as Doris King) help Beal turn his life around.Ms. Fontaine receives a special introduction in this, her firstco-starring role. She is not only very obviously like her famoussister, but also very engaging. Fontaine's performances would grow moreindividual and adept, with increasingly better material. Although nevergrowing into stars of Fontaine's stature, Beal and Huston are alsoquite good. It's nice to see the expressive Beal, who presided over thewitchcraft trial of Quentin Collins on "Dark Shadows", as a leadingman. And, Huston essays a very convincing "drunk" scene.***** The Man Who Found Himself (1937) Lew Landers ~ John Beal, JoanFontaine, Philip Huston
