Fatty's New Role (1915) *** (out of 4) At times hilarious comedy from Keystone has a hobo (Roscoe 'Fatty'Arbuckle) going into a bar to try and get some of its free food but theowner (Mack Swain) kicks him out. To play a prank on the owner, a fewpeople there tell him that the hobo was actually a madman who has beenbombing places that kick him out. FATTY'S NEW ROLE is certainly rightas we get to see Arbuckle in a whole new light and I thought he did awonderful job with the transformation. Playing a drunken bum wasactually a great role for the comedian as he gets off to a great startas he wakes up with some chickens and he really delivers throughout thefilm. His performance is certainly the main reason to watch this andespecially towards the end when he goes back into the bar and doesn'trealize why everyone leaves him there alone. Swain also does a verygood job in his part of the owner who fears that his place is going tobe bombed any moment. The entire subject has a somewhat dark tone to itbut I think this leads to some very big laughs. This here certainlyshows Arbuckle at the top of his skills.
