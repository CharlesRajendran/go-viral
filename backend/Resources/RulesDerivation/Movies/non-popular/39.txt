Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp.They are tortured... We learn North Korean Communists are bad people...We learn Americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture...I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing at this movie.It was the scene when Mr. Reagan comes out from telling the Communistshe wants to be on their side. Then, he asks for a bottle of brandy.Next, acting stone-cold sober, he takes a drunken companion, DeweyMartin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, theNorth Korean communist guard is as dumb as they come. So, the drunkdistracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from adrawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure he boxes weresupposed to contain something; but, of course, Reagan causes them toshake enough to reveal they are empty. Ya gotta laugh! I think"Prisoner of War" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those whoworked on it - otherwise, it's wasteful. * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest,Dewey Martin
