Not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate indepicting torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show thebrutality of the NK POW camps and that's done effectively enough, withsurprising frankness for the time. Whatever technical flaws exist (andthere are plenty) by watching this you'll see a forgotten corner of aforgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again, nasty because it'sbeing done north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay.I don't think any of the Korean veterans brought up his torture whenrunning for office, and if you watch the movies like this one and PorkChop Hill in comparison to the Vietnam films. I don't know if it wasthe people in '54 being trapped in the WWII concepts (the boys tend towisecrack a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see thisfrom the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like"Go Tell The Spartans".
