A fascinating film not only about the making of a silent film inRevolutionary Russia, but by extension, about the inability of humansto see beyond their primary interests, to ignore the wave of historyuntil it all but sweeps over and engulfs them.To a viewer accustomed to linear storytelling and sophisticatedtechnique, this helter-skelter development of a love story between asomewhat scatterbrained actress and her quietly subversive cameramanmay seem disjointed until the revolutionary movement intrudes and theviolence of history intrudes into their country dream. Slave to Love isan odd little film, an immersion into the myths of another country, andwhile I wouldn't watch it twice, it's sincerity of purpose is evident.
