The movie was preposterous, but some fun. Lombard was her typicalluminous self in a role that i could have seen Harlow and/or Monroeplay in later years. To me, the most satisfying part of this mish mashwas Chester Morris. He was so natural an actor and wondered why henever reach super stardom at that time. I seem to recall in his lateryears as "Boston Blackie", in a "B" series...what a wasted. BTW,Lombard made more than one movie with MGM...she made one with ClarkGable, her future husband. I guess she was a free lancer in thosedays..didn't get stuck with 7 year contracts as most actors did inthose days, and regretted it.
