Classic Heinz Rühmann vehicle with Rühmann very good and funny as HansPfeiffer. This is an entertaining film to be sure, but it can not begin tocompete with the 1st adaptation of the material (So ein Flegel,. 1934,q.v.); by staying more closely to the original set-up of the story thanthefirst version, the film is also a bit stuffy at moments and hardly morethana series of comic situations. Helmut Weiss\' direction is good routine, butmisses the talent to make into great comedy.The biggest disappointment may be the main supporting cast with goodactorslike Erich Ponto and Paul Henckels. I can not know what assignment thedirector gave them, but they act like hams thereby killing off any humourintheir parts; Hans Richter as one of the other pupils did a much bettersamejob in "Unser Fräulein Doktor" (1940, q.v.).Also watch for some latent (though by now innocent) Nazi-propaganda here.Ina conversation between two teachers, one of the old guard and the other ofthe new, there is talk of the arrival of new times ("Die neue Zeit") whenthe older one says to the younger that now his time has come withintroducing new teaching methods. Too far fetched? In a couple of scenesbefore this talk we see a disciplined class with the younger teachersayingto Rühmann: Bei mir nicht - Not with me, with the old guard you may dowhatyou want, but not with me, in my class is order (not verbatim).Again remade into a terrible film in 1970 by Helmut Käutner.
