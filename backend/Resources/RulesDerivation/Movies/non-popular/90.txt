George Sanders plays a French doctor without a French accent. He playsGermans well and even speaks in a German accent, but he can't play aFrench doctor without sounding quintessentially English.The young brother of the French protagonist, Jean, is quite bold andbrave standing up for what he believes and speaking out againstoppression. To be honest it;s the French characters that make this filmwork. Sanders merely lends his name to sell the film, but hecontributes very little in terms of his performance.I would advise Sanders fans to stay away from this film as it comesnowhere near the quality of 'Manhunt' or 'Tales of Manhattan'.
