Iam not a Pickford fan,and i have only seen her sound films.So i cameto this with no precoceived notions.I thought that the first half anhour was fairly entertaining particularly the musical number.Howeverwhen the scene changed to Reginald Dennys flat the film eventuallydissolved into a tedious bore.Wildy overacted by Pickford clearly in afailed attempt to give herself a new screen image.Denny must have beenchosen as a leading man as he would provide no competition in theacting stakes.After all who would want to fight over his affections.Isee that 54 viewers out of 73 have given this film a score of 10.Wellall i can say is that you must have been watching a different film.Alli will say is if this film is so good why has it remain largelyunseen.Even Halliwells description is "long unseen musical".I havegiven it a rating of 3 because of the first half hour.Otherwise itwould have been a single digit!
