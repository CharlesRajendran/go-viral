Typical quality-animation from the 1930s Disney studio, but thebaby-centric story is the big let down. The cartoon is full of diapers,safety pins, potties, a bare bottom, lullabies and sugary songs. Therereally is little of lasting interest here.I've just been told by IMDb that I need at least 10 lines to get thisreview published. I can't really say much more about the cartoon. It'snot worth too much extra comment. I will say, however, that on the DVDthere is a section called "Leonard Slatkin Favourites" or somethingsimilar. This cartoon is not among his picks. Now, given that the CD ispopulated by minor Silly Symphonies (there are only two or three of therecognised classic Silly Symphonies), Leonard obviously thinks this oneis fairly dismal.
