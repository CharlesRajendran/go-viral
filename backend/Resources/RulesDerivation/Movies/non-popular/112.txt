While the film has a few interesting moments, "Colleen" is purefluff--and the songs aren't particularly distinguished. Musical fanswill probably be disappointed and non-musical fans probably won't bewon over by the film.The film begins with the rich eccentric owner (Hugh Herbert) of theAmes Company showing up for work--and that's a bad thing. So, it's upto his nephew (Dick Powell) to follow behind and clean up his messes.One mess involves Herbert's relationship with a wicked gold-digger(Joan Blondell) and her 'friend' (Jack Oakey). And when Powell goes toinvestigate the dress shop that Herbert bought for her, he meetsBlondell's bookkeeper (Ruby Keeler) and falls in love. But, it's tooearly in the film and naturally some monkey wrench arises that keepsthem apart until their ultimate and very expected happy ending.As I said above, the film has lots of singing and dancing but none ofit is particularly distinguished. In addition, Miss Keeler (who was agreat dancer) sang too often--and this was a problem since her singingwas pretty flat and lifeless. Oddly, when she danced they often had herdancing with a different guy (not Powell)--probably because he had anice voice but wasn't a dancer. And, she was really a dancer and not asinger--an odd combination.As for the comedy, I agree with another reviewer who felt that basingan entire film around Herbert wasn't a great idea, as he was very mucha one-not performer. He could be good (such as in "The TravelingSaleslady") but he could also become tiresome with his effete mannerand shtick. The brightest spots in the film, I think, were Blondell andOakey, but since it was a musical, this left these two out of much ofthe film--though their musical number together was pretty decent. Allin all, a lot of fluff and a pleasant time-passer at best.
