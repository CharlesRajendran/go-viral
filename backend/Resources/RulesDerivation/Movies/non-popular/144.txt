This movie was at the cutting edge of Indian cinema.It dealt with atheme which is probably all to common in India's villages andsemi-urban areas.Butwhat it brings out is that the same man isattracted greatly to a woman and repelled by her just because of onebody disfigurement.The story pulls at the heartstrings and really brings across thetravail of any young woman,should she be disfigured.Zeenat Aman reallyshinesin this story.The glamour girl of the 70's dons the garb of adisfigured girl and performs with absolute panache.This ,added on toDon really did make 1978 Zeenat's year.Shashi Kapoor is good but notexceptional The depiction of the flood and how human beings areprepared to run roughshod over one another when danger looms isenlightening.
