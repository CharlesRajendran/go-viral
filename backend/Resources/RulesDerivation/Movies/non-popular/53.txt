THE MILKY WAY is a bit of a transitional film from the schmaltzycartoons of the 1930s and the more enjoyable and irreverent films ofthe 40s and 50s. Younger viewers might not know that in the 30s, many(way too many) cartoons were filled with sappy music and cutesy imagesand in many ways THE MILKY WAY is one of the last of these dreadfulfilms. Considering that it was made by Rudolf Ising (who made a careerof this style film), it isn't at all surprising that I hated the film.There's just so much singing and saccharine that I found myself wantingto see it infused with some Tex Avery sensibilities.On the positive side, the animation was exceptional and showed thateven before good writers and directors came to MGM's cartoon divisionin subsequent years, the animation was already stellar. In many ways,you could see the roots of the upcoming and very successful Tom & Jerrycartoons in this film. If only this film had an edge--it might havebeen a lot better. As it is, it's only a very pretty bit of treaclewith a few nice touches.Amazingly, it somehow garnered the Oscar for Best Animated Short.Apparently, the Academy were saps for this sort of stuff.
