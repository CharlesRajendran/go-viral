During the 1920s, Frank Fay was the highest paid performer invaudeville, the comedian from whom Jack Benny candidly admitted helifted his on-stage style. By 1931 when "God's Gift to Women" wasreleased, he had married Barbara Stanwyck and groomed her for stardomwhile his own career was rapidly declining. An arrogant drunk with aflair for alienating his fellow performers, Fay's downfall didn't getmuch sympathy though it purportedly inspired the movie, "A Star isBorn." For more than a decade, he was the classic example of a"used-to-was" until the producers of the Broadway play, "Harvey,"tapped him to play Elwood P. Dowd. It was among the most memorablestage performances I've ever seen, a classic of fey (sic) whimsy andsuperb comedy timing. Jimmy Stewart in the screen version, couldn'tcome close. Suddenly, a far less arrogant Frank Fay was enjoying theaccolades that had eluded him since the late 1920s. Watch "God's Giftto Women," a stiff, stilted early pre-code romantic romp and you'll seeboth why Fay's career went downhill and conversely why he had the idealvaguely befuddled style to play a man with a six foot tall rabbit as apal.
