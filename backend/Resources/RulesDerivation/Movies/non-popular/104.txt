It\'s very difficult to put into words just how poor & tedious this film isto watch. It was a chore to sit through such a dire, tiresome andinsultingly substandard cinematic effort - I want to claim back the timeittook to watch this, and the small amount of cash I bought it for. (Eventhough I think i picked it up for Â£1:99)
