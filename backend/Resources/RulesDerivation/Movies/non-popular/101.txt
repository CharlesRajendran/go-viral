Renegade Girl stars Ann Savage in this Lippert Production about a BelleStarr like outlaw who after some service with Quantrill's Raiders leadsan outlaw band. The story is a rehashed version not of the real BelleStarr's story, but of the 20th Century Fox film that starred GeneTierney and Randolph Scott. Elements of that plot are definitelypresent.For the tough leader of an outlaw band this woman has a lot of issues.She has a mission that tops all, to get Chief Thundercloud who isanother renegade leader who has a grudge against her family theShelbys. What the grudge is we're not told, but he's wiped out herwhole family except for her.Ann's got Union Cavalry captain Alan Curtis and fellow outlaw RussellWade panting after her, but her mission comes first.Renegade Girl is a poorly plotted and shoddily directed affair. Onlythe most confirmed B western addicts should be looking at this one.
