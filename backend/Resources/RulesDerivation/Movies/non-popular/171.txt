This flick was made for television and is only available in the US onex-rental VHS. It was made just before the new rise of the horrors. Butthis really is a turkey. You really must see the special effects used.It's about a man being cursed by some inmates when he is on holiday.Soon he realizes that he's a werewolf. He hunts his preys on the resorthe is staying but I must say, where is the blood. I haven't ween onedrip of the red stuff in this flick. There are even shootings andpeople get hurt but no sign of blood. The best part are the last fewseconds when we have a close-up of the face of the werewolf. Thewerewolf itself looks ridicuulous. The effects used are just done withsome cheap editing. It reminded me of The Wolfman of 1941 were theyused the same effect. But overall it's more about a love story betweena woman and the so called werewolf. The cover of the VHS looks amazing,if that was included in this flick, well, it surely would be a classic.No sign of those hands or even of the naked girl. It also reminded meof Paul Naschy's performances as a werewolf. But the reason why somepeople track it down is for Joe Perry, here in one of his first fullfeatures just before becoming famous in Jake And The Fatman. Rarefeature that must be seen to believe.
