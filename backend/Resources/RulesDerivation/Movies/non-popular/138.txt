RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her asa flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL)come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this littleprogrammer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of JoanFontaine.Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and JohnBeal is okay as her love interest. But it\'s obvious that PHILIP HUSTON(who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) isthe actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine. Whateverhappened to this handsome actor? Why didn\'t RKO promote him, along withFontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian.These are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as I watchedthis rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promiseof its title. The story itself is rather tiresome, only occasionallycoming to life because of Fontaine\'s spirited heroine.She photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressionsskillfully, suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a futuredate. Beal never did go on to a distinguished career and hisperformance here shows why. Strictly lackluster.But whatever happened to Philip Huston? Evidence here is that he shouldhave had a worthwhile film career.Trivia note: Watch for Dwight Frye (of "Dracula") as the out of controlpatient aboard the airplane.
