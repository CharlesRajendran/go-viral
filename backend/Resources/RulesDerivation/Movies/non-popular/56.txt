A hideous ginger baby is sung to sleep by his mother and imagines asurreal dreamland. The dream gradually changes from restful, todangerous, to scary, and then back to peaceful. It's hardly a classic,and it features that hideous old Disney animation that is vivid yetaesthetically displeasing, but if you were to watch this late at nightit would make you feel sleepy, so I guess it works in some weird way.There are no voices other than the disembodied singing and norecognizable Disney characters. It's directed by an uncredited WilfredJackson, who went on to direct Peter Pan, Cinderella, and Alice inWonderland.Does anyone else think that the little baby looks likes 1980s Commodore64 character Jack the Nipper?
