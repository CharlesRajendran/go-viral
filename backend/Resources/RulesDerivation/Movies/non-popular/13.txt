When a crooked banker/railroad man attempts to swindle some farmers,Sheriff Gabby Hayes sends word to his old friend Jesse James (RoyRogers), who robs the banks and railroads in order to make thingsright. The villain retaliates by hiring Jesse's slack-jawed double(Rogers again) to make trouble in order to discredit James.Jesse James At Bay is a typical but okay vehicle for Roy, who's prettygood at playing the heavy, though he gets to sing only once during themovie and then only a few verses.This is Roger's second time playing double in a movie, the first timebeing as Billy the kid and Billy's good-guy replacement in 1938's BillyThe Kid Returns and the third being 1942's Sunset On The Desert.
