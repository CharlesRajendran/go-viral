Nothing especially dramatic or compelling here. A formulaic andpredictable western with a meandering script and a distinct lack ofcharacter development, this picture tells its story and is over in anhour. It is loaded with non-sequiturs and loose ends which leaves theviewer scratching his head.Nevertheless, the leads are attractive. Tim Holt gives a stalwartperformance and Martha O'Driscoll is very pretty but is not given muchto do. This is the sort of movie I probably would have liked a longtime ago when I was a kid and didn't ask many questions. The actionscenes were good and the second unit stuff was even better.This picture was on TCM the other morning. It was a time-killer but didnot break any new ground as far as the western genre is concerned. Thekids won't notice, though.
