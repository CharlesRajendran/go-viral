OK, so children's stories are among the easiest to spoof, and "ThreeLittle Pigs" is clearly in that number. The Termite Terrace crowd didit not only with "The Windblown Hare", but also "Pigs in a Polka" (inwhich the story is set to Johannes Brahms's "Hungarian Dance"*), "TheTurn-Tale Wolf" (in which the wolf exposes that the pigs were bullies)and "Three Little Bops" (in which the story is told as a jazz song).And those are just the adaptations of this one story! Anyway, thiscartoon has the three little pigs knowing that the big bad wolf iscoming to blow their houses down, so they decide to sell their housesto some unsuspecting sucker. Who should come along but a certain scwewywabbit? To be certain, once Bugs Bunny and the wolf realize that thepigs have set them both up, they both decide that it's time to takecharge.Probably the coolest scene is the whole "Little Red Riding Hood"sequence, as it goes to show the guys making these cartoons weren'tafraid to create stories as outlandish as they wanted. This one looksmostly like a placeholder in between the really great cartoons, butit's still worth seeing.*You may recognize that song from "The Great Dictator", in the scenewhere Charlie Chaplin shaves the man.
