Tanks Are Coming, The (1941) ** (out of 4)Oscar-nominated short has George Tobias playing a new recruit who givesup his taxi cab so that he can join the Army where he soon findshimself driving a tank. This short left me somewhat disappointed butthere are still a couple things that make it worth viewing. The firstis that it was filmed in three-strip Technicolor and I must say thatthis is one of the best looking examples of this color. The colorsreally jump off the screen and it certainly belongs right up there withThe Adventures of Robin Hood in terms of its beautiful color. Thesecond reason to watch is because it was actually filmed at Fort Knox,Kentucky. Having grown up fifteen-miles from there, I got an added kickout of how it looked back in the day. With that said, the story itselfis a rather weak one and I really didn't get too many kicks out of thecomedy style Tobias brought to the film. There were countless pre-WW2shorts back in the day but this here isn't one of the best.
