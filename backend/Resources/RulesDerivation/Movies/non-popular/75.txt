This is a short film by D. W. Griffith for Biograph Studios and is fullof some pretty exciting action. Blanche Sweet is an apparently nicegirl that was kidnapped and secreted aboard a boat. The only problemis, WHY?! There's really no context and I had no idea why some crewmembers from a sailing ship kidnapped the woman in the first place andwhy later they tried to kill the captain and take the boat. Someexplanatory inter-title cards or making the film longer than 13 minutesmight have taken care of all this. With just a little more work, thiscould have been an excellent little film. And, given that it's aGriffith film, you KNOW that the woman will be rescued (they always arein his films)--so there isn't all that much excitement or suspense.It's a time-passer and that's all.
