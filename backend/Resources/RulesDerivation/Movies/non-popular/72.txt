"Mystery of Marie Roget" is a sub-par B-movie from Universal. While thestory purports to be from the Edgar Allan Poe story, it's really verydifferent.When the film begins, Marie has been reported missing and the policehave so far found nothing. They do eventually find a corpse that MIGHTbe her...but her face is missing. When they tell her family thatthey've found her, she then walks in the house...so the corpseobviously was NOT her. However, eventually Marie really is murdered andit's up to Poe's Dupin character (Patric Knowles) to solve the murder.As for Dupin, he's a know-it-all who acts a lot like the movie versionof Sherlock Holmes and has a partner (Lloyd Corrigan) who is evenstupider and more useless than the movie version of Watson. In fact,he's such a bumbling moron that it totally ruins the movie...as doesDupin's bizarre manner in which he investigates. Overall, just a sillyand inconsequential B murder mystery--complete with all the usualclich√©s and plot problems. A time-passer at best...but you could easilydo better.
