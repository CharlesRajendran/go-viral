I do like sad movies, ones that tugs at your heartstrings, I do lovethe movie Somewhere in Time by the way. However this movie is the mostfrustrating movie I have watched in a long time. What I don't likeabout this so-called tearjerker is that the wife, played by MargaretSullivan, never tells her husband she is dying. He only finds it out atthe very end of the movie by error when he sees a pill bottle on thebedroom table and calls up the doctor who tells him. Even the doctordoesn't tell him. She thinks she's saving him grief by not telling him,but to me she's just selfish. This was six months after she knew shehad cancer. The first half an hour was okay, but when her husband ishaving an affair with his co-worker, even then she tells no one.Nothing in this movie seemed genuine. They even played a melody from aBrahm's symphony which I love, over and over to the point where Icouldn't stand to listen to it any more. The acting was artificial fromeveryone. If you like soap operas this might be enjoyable, but forpeople who like sad movies every once in a while, this wasdisappointing and a waste of my time. Margaret Sullivan's last moviewas not her best
