Much confusion surrounds this title, not helped by the fact thatseemingly there are at least three distinct versions. Others have triedto clarify this so i shall just make my comments on Lust at FirstSight. This is not the horror version so although atmospheric and withsome gore and much talk of bats, vampires and things that go bump inthe night, this is there version where we can appreciate more ofAnnette Haven than her acting ability. Actually her performance andmost of the others is admirable but the most amazing thing about thisversion is the number of adult stars are performing together here.Haven is the star but Gillis is a marvellous Count Dracula as everyonewould expect. There are some limp moments but for the most part this isvery well staged and some most rewarding scenes. Its all a bit cut upbut then if you are going to get three films from one I guess thatsinevitable and the big plus is that no scene goes on and on forever.Excellent - I must get round to watching the horror version!
