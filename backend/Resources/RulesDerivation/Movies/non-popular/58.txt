Behind the Mask (1946) ** (out of 4) Phil Karlson directed this second entry in "The Shadow" series. In thisfilm, a sleazy news reporter is murdered and everyone thinks The Shadowwas behind it. The alter ego Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) must provethat The Saint wasn't the murderer and find the real one. Every studioduring this era had a mystery fighter on their hands and The Shadowbelonged to Monogram, which should tell you just about everything youneed to know. There's no question that the material here is more secondrate than anything else and in the end this just isn't a very memorablemovie. I think a lot of the problem goes to the screenplay, which isjust rather routine as there's nothing in it that really separates thisfrom the countless other films like it. It certainly doesn't helpmatters that Cranston is such a boring character that the viewer cannever really connect with or really care about what happens to. Anotherproblem is that there's way too much comic stuff. Yes, a mixture ofcomedy and mystery can be good but not when the jokes fall so flat. Thesupporting characters are just annoying and especially the assistant'sgirl who is written as that dumb blonde that gets on everyone's nerves.Richmond really isn't all that energetic or charismatic in the role ofThe Saint. I'm not sure if he just wasn't interested in the part orperhaps the screenplay just didn't excite him enough to give it more ofa push. The supporting players are mostly forgettable, although no oneis so bad to where they ruin the film. BEHIND THE MASK will remainwatchable for fans of the genre but I think they'll realize thatthere's not much going on here.
