This early film is difficult to assess. On the one hand, it's awonderful historical document as it's one of the first sit-com orrom-coms ever made. It introduces situations which would become morefamiliar in subsequent decades. But, on the other, the style of thefilm is crude and antiquated--even when it debuted.The Huttons are a stupid couple. And, through a series ofmisunderstandings they come to suspect (incorrectly) that their spouseis being unfaithful. When they go to their lawyer, he suggests they'live together separately'. In other words, stay together in the samehome but have nothing to do with each other! This brilliant plan seemsplausible at first but naturally by the end the couple realizes theirlawyer is a complete idiot and they reconcile.The film has a great plot. The problem is that instead of playing as afluid narrative, it's shown in vignette form--with intertitle cardsover-explaining what is going to happen. As a result, it comes off aspreachy and forced, not at all natural. This really blunts the comedicvalue in the film.
