In the last few scenes of Benny from Panama, when his old sailor buddyshows up at the hotel room, he brings along a pesky mosquito. Thismosquito character is surely a groundbreaking attempt at integratingcartoon animation into film with live actors. Also, the mosquito fromPanama attacks and bites the sailor's toe while he's sleeping on thecouch. The close-up camera shot of his toe, enhanced by animatedthrobbing, was very cute and novel for the day. There are about 8-10close-ups of the mosquito, which are cartoon-like and have varyingscale, but the use of the characterization of an annoyed and irritatedmosquito is something all viewers can relate to and makes the scene inthe hotel room very funny.
