Okay, the plot needs a Rosetta Stone to unravel, while affections andalliances shift faster than wind-blown hay and are about thatwell-motivated. Top that with action that never leaves LA's SanFernando Valley, plus acting prowess that sort of comes and goes, andwe're left with what amounts to a cinematic morass. And oh yes,shouldn't forget how everyone insists on marriage before playtime.Isn't that just what you'd expect from these hardened outlaw types,(thanks production code censors). Still, I've got to say, for what it's worth, that the narrative oftenavoids cliché. That is, people die that you don't expect, a girl hasthe lead even if it is non-girlish Ann Savage, while neither theYankees, Confederates, nor Quantrills, are romanticized. Thus, despitethe many muddy moments, there are points of interest scatteredthroughout. So, it seems to me that with a stylish director, anunburdened screenwriter, a bigger budget, and at least a 90-minuteruntime, there's a pretty good epic western lurking somewhere in theLippert shambles.(In passingthanks johnboy1221, you confirmed my suspicions about thedisappearing knife: what a tacky omission. Also, I may be seeingthings, but those well-scrubbed close-ups of Savage at times resemblean unsmiling Marilyn Monroe, of all people. See what you think.)
