This time out Fatty is a amiable tramp and of course it's not difficultto make him look the part. He sleeps in a barn and tries to get himselfa free breakfast and drink at Schnitz's Bar but gets thrown out. He'slong gone but when the 'friends' of the owner read in the paper that aman has been causing havoc in bars after being thrown out, they play ajape on him that would land them in a secret CIA jail nowadays. Theycook up a fake terrorist plot suggesting that his bar will be visitedby a bomb at three o'clock.Needless to say Fatty returns arrives back at three o'clock with alittle money and chaos ensues. Talk about changing times! This is afilm that not only couldn't be made today, if it was tried it would getthe term 'plot device' banned. It certainly wouldn't be seen as comedy,but an anti-American attempt to throw scorn on the country's record onhandling domestic terror threats.As a film it isn't bad and is actually enjoyable for its lack of pace.The usual suspects are all here, with their outrageous facial hair:Mack Swain as Ambrose Schnitz, the bar owner, Edgar Kennedy, SlimSummerville and many of the rentacops of the era like Al St John. Noneof them get to kick anyone else's ass, literally or figuratively, andthat seems like a real treat. I'm just sorry I missed Luke the Dog, ashe was apparently in there somewhere, and he would have been myfavourite actor in the film.
