As I write these comments, the repercussions from the O.J. Simpsonbook/TV show/media blitz over his "If I Did It" book are still rumblingthrough the news. This movie is based on a 'work of fiction' by thewidow of Arnold Rothstein, the notorious gambler who may have fixed the1919 World Series -- the infamous 'Black Sox Scandal.' Of course, thewife of the gambler is portrayed as open, loving and entirely unawareof the slimy side of her husband's dealings. Watching this movie,thoughts of self-serving bits of keyhole fictions kept popping up,making me generally disgusted with it, its chipper moron of a heroineand annoyed at Spencer Tracy's, as usual, straightforward and excellentportrayal of a bad guy. While it can work, here, with the general senseof disingenuity that beclouds the entire proceedings, the effect isdisgusting.This is a shame, because Tracy is surrounded by actors and actresseswho actually can get in a scene with him and inhabit the same universe-- all too often in this period, Tracy seemed to be the only genuinehuman being in these productions. Henry O'Neill is fine as the oldfriend of Tracy's who is now an honest cop and is intent on putting himin jail, and who will not even accept a toy for his daughter, played byShirley Temple. It's also fun to watch Alice Faye, who is in herplatinum blonde phase, playing a voracious gold digger. After the Codebegan to be enforced, she would turn into a sweet-tempered lady on thescreen. But they can't save this smarmy whitewash job.
