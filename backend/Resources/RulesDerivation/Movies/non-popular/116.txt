In Possession (1984) ** (out of 4) A few chills are pretty much wasted in this episode from the FoxMystery Theater. Frank and Sylvia Daly (Carol Lynley, ChristopherCazenove) are on a business meeting when they walk into their hotelroom and notice an elderly woman and her daughter. It turns out thesewere spirits and two years later the couple are in a new home when theystart to experience mysterious things. IN POSSESSION actually gets offto a pretty strong start as the pre-title sequence manages to be quitecreepy. Director Val Guest manages to build up some nice suspenseduring the routine but effective opening but sadly the rest of the filmjust slowly falls apart. There are many problems with the movie but themajority of them can be blamed on the screenplay, which just runs outof ideas as it goes along. After a while you just get bored with thetwo people constantly "seeing" new items. These items include spirits,dead bodies, weird lights and other visual objects but they are neverscary and after a while they just become boring. Obviously in a filmlike this there's going to be a big mystery that gets revealed but whenit finally happens I really can't say that I was shocked or didn't seeit coming. The film benefits from the two leads who offer up fineperformances and the supporting cast isn't too bad either. Guest doeswhat he can do inject some life into the story but after a while it'sjust one clich√© after another.
