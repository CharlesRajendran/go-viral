This is one of Curly's last Stooges shorts, and it's more than evidentby watching this that he was very, very ill. He had lost a lot ofweight, his reflexes were slow, his speech was halting and he didn'thave the spark and mischievousness that his fans had come to expect. Hewas in such poor health that it was actually discomforting to watch Moeand Larry slap him, kick him, and do all the things to him that werefunny in his previous shorts, but due to his ill health it lookeduncomfortably like they were beating up a helpless old man. The plot,about three ex-GIs coming home from World War II and discovering thatthey don't have a place to live and can't find anyplace that will takethem, is somewhat topical--there actually was a severe housing shortageimmediately following WW II--but the short itself is stiff and stilted,mainly due, I think, to Curly's slowed-down reactions due to hishealth. The "old" Curly comes to life for a minute or two when he ispreparing "dinner" for the three of them in the backyard they're livingin, but otherwise this short is the beginning of the end of Curly'scareer, and it's sad to watch.
