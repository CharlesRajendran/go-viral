Whether this featherweight entertainment is for you or not, dependsentirely on whether you fancy the dancing talent of RUBY KEELER (notexactly the world's greatest dancer), DICK POWELL (not exactly theworld's best crooner) and JOAN BLONDELL (not exactly the world'sgreatest musical talent). What they do have is charm, in spades, andaside from their bright personalities and some clowning by JACK OAKIE,there's really not much else here that you haven't seen a dozen timesbefore.HUGH HERBERT is there for some eccentric laughs as a giddy millionairethat nephew DICK POWELL must save from the clutches of a gold digger(JOAN BLONDELL of course), while falling for office worker RUBY KEELER.Herbert's comic delivery is as broad and screwball as can be andbecomes tiresome when so many of the early scenes are consumed by hisbrand of humor. In other words, a little bit of Hugh Herbert goes along way.The screwball plot goes from silly to sillier in no time with most ofthe complications revolving around Herbert's eccentric ways withrunning a business. Blondell bats her eyes on cue, Ruby Keller takes astab at being an unlikely bookkeeper, and Powell treats both of themwith boyish charm, occasionally belting out a song without a song cuein sight.To be charitable, even for fans of Powell and Keeler, this one ispretty hard to take. Even a fashion show production number a half-hourinto the film lacks the zip and distinction usually found in these sortof musicals, clumsily choreographed with a dance by Keeler and PAULDRAPER.DICK POWELL manages to emerge with reputation intact--but no wonder hetired of these flimsily constructed musicals, this one suffering fromlow-budget production values and a bad script. Thankfully, he went onto better things in future roles with a switch from musicals to crimedrama.As for RUBY KEELER, what can I say? She's charming and pleasant to lookat--but that's about it and JOAN BLONDELL is seen to better advantagein dozens of other films.
