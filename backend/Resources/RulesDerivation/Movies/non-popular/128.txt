After seeing this film and looking at the reviews, it's obvious thatthis film is yet another case where rabid fans see EVERYTHING theirfavorite stars is in is pure cinema gold! Heck, giving ANY Three Stoogefilm a 10 is hard to imagine, but in the case of this abysmal film,it's a crime against common sense and IMDb fans! The reality is thatthis is a truly awful film in every possible way, though it is veryimportant historically since it's the first Three Stooges film. Evenmost of the die-hard Stooges fans will hate this film as it's nothinglike later films and just isn't funny.Like all the early Stooge's films, their front man was Ted Healy--arather obnoxious and abrasive vaudevillian who spent all his timesmacking the crap out of the hapless Stooges. While in later Stoogefilms without Healy this violence was funny and comical, with Healy ittended to just be cruel and it was a great move by the boys to dumptheir rather vicious front man.So why was it so bad? Well, it's very obvious that MGM didn't know whatto do with the team and put very little effort into producing the filmdespite the fact that it was in the expensive Two-Color Technicolorprocess. This decision was less based on their commitment to the teamand more because they had some existing two-color clips and wanted tocombine them with the Stooge clips to save a few bucks. This wascertainly NOT done in a seamless manner and the existing song and danceclips were simply dreadful--totally dull and unappealing. Plus, some ofthe clips and dialog have absolutely nothing to do with Nursery Rhymes!The end result was uninteresting and showed little to indicate that theteam would one day make it big. Unfortunately for the studio, thistrend continued until the team made the jump to Columbia and the restis history.See it only for historical purposes--don't say I didn't warn you!
