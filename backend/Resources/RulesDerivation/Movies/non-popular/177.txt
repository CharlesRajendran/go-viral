I have never heard of the phrase 'Ticket of Leave', but I can safelyassume from watching the story that it is referring to a person who isparoled out of prison.The basic idea behind "The Ticket of Leave Man" is decent and the storyshould have been a lot better. After all, it does involve an evilcriminal who not only steals but garrotes his victims! And, the guylater frames an innocent man only because he hopes to one day use himin his gang--but first he needs to break the man! However, the storyitself is quite poor--mostly because of some horrible over-acting byTod Slaughter who plays the evil killer. Subtle his performanceisn't--and he even snickers a bit like Snidely Whiplash! Additionally,a few of the other performances are less than stellar. Because of thehigh cheese factor, it's really hard to recommend the film--unless youare making up a list of movies that SHOULD have been better or onesthat featured very hammy performances.
