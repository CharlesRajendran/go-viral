It's almost as if Warner Bros. was preparing audiences for there-release of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD by having this proclamationmade several times by Little John in this Bugs Bunny cartoon, RABBITHOOD. And perhaps it was planned that way, because the feature wasreleased to theaters around this time.Anyway, it's another Bugs Bunny romp with the Sheriff of Nottinghamcatching him poaching carrots from the King's Garden. From then on,it's the usual shenanigans with Bugs putting one over on the Sheriff,even donning disguises in an effort to convince the man that he's theking. All of it, of course, is extremely silly but leads toward a goodfinish with footage of Flynn actually appearing when Robin Hood finallydoes show up.As amusing as it is, it's not one of my favorite Bugs Bunnycartoons--there were so many others that were much funnier than this.Mel Blanc does a terrific job on the voices.
