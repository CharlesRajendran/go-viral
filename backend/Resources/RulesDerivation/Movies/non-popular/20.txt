Compared to the first cartoon with Rocky, Mugsy and Bugs Bunny, this ispretty mediocre. The first one was my favourite Bugs Bunny episode, ithad clever jokes, clever lines, a good plot and good animation - eventhe little bit of farce in it was good. However, this cartoon, there istoo much farce, the plot is boring and repetitive (Bugs constantlytrying to trick Rocky into thinking that Mugsy is trying to injure him)and there are only a few good lines and very few clever jokes.In this episode, Bugs Bunny has moved from his burrow to a nice,comfortable basement in an empty house - when suddenly, two gangstersarrive back home, bank robbers. When Bugs Bunny realizes what they areup to, he plans to put a stop to the robbers' robbing...I recommend this episode to anyone who is very new to Looney Tunes, toanyone who likes farce and to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny being meanerthan usual. Otherwise you may not enjoy this, but I guess it is worth ago for the average Looney Tunes fan. Enjoy "Bugsy and Mugsy"! :-)6 and a half out of ten.
