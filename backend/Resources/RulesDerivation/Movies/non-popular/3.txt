"Odds And Evens" is not one of the best films of the BudSpencer-Terence Hill team. There are some funny scenes (Terencepretending to be an amateur at playing cards, Bud explaining whathappens to him when somebody wakes him up abruptly, Bud\'s encounterwith a drunk truck driver), and the final showdown takes place on aboat that hosts a small casino - needless to say, the boys make fulluse of its props. But the storytelling is labored, tiresome and naive;the 111-minute running time is way too much for a movie of this type.If more gags were as witty as the last one, we\'d be onto somethinghere. (**)
