Mary Astor is "The Runaway Bride" in this early talkie directed byDonald Crisp - and not very well, I might add. The young and beautifulAstor is Mary Gray, who is eloping with her fianc√©e (David Newell). Hedrives too fast, is wealthy, and doesn't want to work. Mary wants ahusband who will make something of himself. For unexplained reasons,Mary doesn't seem to realize what this man is like until they elope.Mary breaks off the engagement, and he leaves the suite they've rentedto make arrangements for the wedding because he's determined to marryher. While he's gone, a robber enters her room and, unbeknownst to her,hides $80,000 worth of stolen pearls in her purse. He's killed bysomeone else, and then the police show up. With the help of a maid,Mary makes a run for it and winds up as a cook in the home of a wealthybachelor (Lloyd Hughes). But the gang still wants their pearls.Convoluted and directed in a meandering fashion, this film suffers fromETS (early talkie syndrome). The dialogue is said slowly, with pausesin between, throwing the rhythm of the film off. I just saw "Paid" fromaround the same time, and for some reason, that film doesn't sufferfrom this. But so many early talkies do, with the actors not used tospeaking.Dated, draggy, and predictable, this film is only worth seeing forAstor, who in spite of the problems, manages to do quite well. Actuallythe performances aren't bad. But the story! Ouch.
