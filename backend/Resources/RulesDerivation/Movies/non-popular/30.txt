Chester Morris is "Office Boy," a sort of assistant to Nat Pendleton'shead gangster. Pendleton has the hots for chorus girl Carole Lombardand is eventually persuaded (not easily!) to marry her.The relationship between Office Boy and Lombard's Mary hovers betweenunfriendly and hostile for the majority of the picture, and is wellsummed up by the wedding gift with which Office Boy presents her: achisel! Yes, Mary is strictly out for the money, and poor boy Morrisaloyal employee but nobody's foollets her know that he sees through herphony hysterics and overblown romantic antics. Well, it's prettyobvious from this point that the situation, shall we say, is bound todevelop.The plot isn't much. Lombard's character is unsympathetic, at timesdownright annoying. The supporting cast frustrates, too: Leo Carillo'sGreek gangster butchers English pronunciation but is more irritatingthan funny or sinister, and Zasu Pitts is only given one good scene inwhat could have been an ideal role for her as Lombard's friend andconfidante. Pendleton is energetic but dumber than you'd think a mobboss could possibly be.So when things really do start to pop, it's difficult to throw yoursympathies, much less belief, behind what's happening. However, CaroleLombard successfully pulls it off: her early hamming is only a setupfor her excellent late scenes in which her character's genuine warmthpushes aside the cold-hearted faker previously on display. We canalmost believe that Morris's character would actually fall for her.Morris, by the way, is excellent throughouta straight man amongcaricatures, he holds his own and is never overshadowed. It's kind of a silly movie, certainly uneven and not close to entirelysuccessful in the way it veers back and forth between comedy andmelodrama. But as a fan of both Lombard and Morris, I wouldn't want tomiss it. Ultimately, neither star disappoints.
