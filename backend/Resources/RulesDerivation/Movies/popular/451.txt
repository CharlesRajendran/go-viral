If you haven\'t seen this movie you are missing Tyrone Power\'s bestperformance. It\'s a beautiful love story, and the ending is memorable.This movie is almost impossible to find in the rental store in theU.S.A, but I think it is available in England. This story is acandidate for a remake by a savvy producer, and I hope, but doubt itwill ever be remade. I think the movie should be re-released and placedin the racks of the rental store, so others of the new generation wouldhave the opportunity to see this entertaining flick. I recommend thismovie, especially if you want to see a love story the way they wereportrayed approximately 40 years ago.
