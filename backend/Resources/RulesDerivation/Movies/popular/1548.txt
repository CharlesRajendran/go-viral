This is one of the most memorable and moving films I saw in the 70s.Perfectly photographed and gently presented, this drama of a familydissecting how they feel about their artist father and his island atollexistence transports the viewer to genuinely feel as though we havebeen there as well. I revisited this film several times in 1978 takingfriends and family and it became a completely immersing experience, andeach visit made me admire the production, writing and themes more. Itis presented as a trilogy, a family photo album in three parts, eachwith quiet profound realizations (without the screaming today wouldneed) and presents the often sad or misplaced loyalty / admiration this'great man' (Scott) commands but does not perhaps deserve. It is just agreat great film instead. The scene in the second sequence whereestranged wife Claire Bloom visits and takes him for a walk along thebeach contains some of the most powerful acting I have ever enjoyed..especially when Scott realizes why she has visited. Any time you seethis film available, buy it or see it or take a good friend or familypal. Make it part of your life. I wish I could get a DVD and keep it soI can see it anytime. The music score is unforgettable. ISLANDS IN THESTREAM is one of the great 70s movies. Sad that it is so unknown. Butyou can change that. Spectacular young actor Hart Bochner possibly 19at the time is the eldest of the three brothers, the younger twomatching him as excellent actors. David Hemmings, just on the verge oflosing his BLOW UP looks plays a drunken pal, and the glorious ClaireBloom as mentioned above is sublime. Add that to the Goldsmith scoreand the tropical locale, it is a solidly realized family drama thatdeserves wide appreciation.
