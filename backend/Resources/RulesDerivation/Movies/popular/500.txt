As usual James Cagney provides nothing short of his usual high standard,in this light comedy/drama with a dark edge. Seeming more relevant now,especially with all the recent scandals involving the paparazzi and it\'sstars, this movie takes the usual \'Cagney\' structure. He starts out a brokebad boy on the ropes, but with his wiley charm and dodgy dealings, doesgood. Cagney is impossible to hate, even when, as in this movie he becomesas obnoxious as ever. In particular the scene in which the Fireman, comes tofind the man who got his picture on the front page. It is in scenes likethis, that Cagney shows his deft comic touch, something so under-used in hislong and prestigious career. In short The Picture Snatcher, is well worth anhour and a half of anyones time. Although by no means Cagney\'s best, itstill holds up well against an \'Accidental Hero\'. Enjoy!!!
