Valentino was still something of an unknown quantity when this film wasmade, and although it was adapted from the screen by his mentor JuneMathis and designed by his wife Natasha Rambova, CAMILLE is not aValentino film. It belongs instead to Alla Nazimova, whose eccentriccharm that combined both frantic gaiety and an exhaustedworld-weariness made her the most highly regarded "high-art" performerof her day.Surely by now every one knows at least the basic outline of the story,which French author Dumas drew from life: Marguerite Gautier (Nazimova)is a celebrated courtesan who despises her life and yet cannot breakfree of it. When confronted with true love in the form of society youthArmand (Valentino), however, she attempts to leave her pastbehind--only to be convinced by her lover\'s father that if she reallyloves Armand she must leave him that he might take his rightful placein society. She returns to her old life, where she dies of consumptionwith her one true love\'s name upon her lips.Nazimova, who is credited with introducing the Russian "method" to theNew York stage, is an extremely interesting Camille. Unlike the laterGarbo, she offers us a truly neurotic creature who in public screamswith nervous energy--and then in private collapses under the twinweights of self-loathing and her increasing illness. At times herperformance goes as far over the top as her hairstyle, but thecumulative result is exceptionally affecting. Valentino is typicallyValentino, with an intriguing presence that relies more upon appearancethan actual skill, and his performance adds no significant dimension tothe part of Armand; this may, however, be an unfair criticism, for therole is notoriously thankless.Rambova\'s strange set design for Marguerite\'s apartment is a highlightof the film and worth studying, very 1920s modern and yet still faradvanced of anything commonly seen in even contemporary decor, and thecinematography gives CAMILLE an effectively lyrical feel. All in all,the film might best be considered as a high-art experiment that doesnot entirely come off, but even so it gives us the opportunity to seeNazimov near the height of her appeal, and as such is recommended toall silent film fans.Gary F.
