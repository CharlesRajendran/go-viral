Only currently available through the AmericanFilm Institute, which restored the film, this features a remarkableperformance by one of the great stage actresses in the early part of the20th Century.One sees immediately why Ms. Eagels was a star; this is apowerful, emotional tour-de-force which lasts a little over an hour.Littlemore than a filmed stage play for the most part, this film is a veryimportant re-discovery that deserves to get into bettercirculation.
