In the days when actresses had genuine accents that put a lilt in theirspeech, Hedy Lamarr, like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, had refinementandintelligence,  and could portray "foreigners" from any number ofcountries.Here, Hedy is supposed to be Russian, and with a light touch, too. Shemakesa charming foil to beefy Clark Gable, who plays his usual role as themacho-male with a wink in his eye covering a heart of gold. Theirchemistryis not quite as magical as that in "It Happened One Night," with ClaudetteColbert (who had the softer edge and mysterious sex appeal that trulycomplemented Gable\'s), or even his pairings with the brassy blonde withtheBrooklyn accent, but there are a number of scenes in this farce that Ihavenot seen equalled elsewhere: namely the escape scene in the Soviet tank.Before the age of graphic simulation, the prop men really had to come upwith a phalanx of Soviet-style tanks -- unless they used miniatures, andtosee them "chase" Gable, with Hedy at the wheel, is almost on a par with aChaplin or Keaton routine. The miming of the Soviet tank armyisalso hilarious.
