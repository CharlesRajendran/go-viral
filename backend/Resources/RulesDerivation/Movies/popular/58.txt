Unavailable on DVD, but found on VHS at Blockbuster, "Mr Lucky" is aCary Grant vehicle, even more than a morale boosting, "keep the homesfires burning" war movie. Grant gets to play a wide range of roleshere: fashion plate, grifter, romantic lead, war hero and (mostnotably) knitter of sweaters. Look, I've seen them all: North ByNorthwest, Bringing Up Baby, To Catch A Thief, and on and on.This hasmany moments that match the very best that Cary Grant had on offer.Most notably, there's an extended sequence of Grant riffing in Cockneyto Laraine Day. Now Cary Grant liked to identify himself as a Cockney(which is usually termed as an East Londoner), but here he gets therare opportunity in his movie career to play one (also in Gunga Din),and when asked where he picked up the rhyming slang that makes Cockneyso annoying (charming to Americans) he says: Australia ! AhHollywood... You've also got to admire the sartorial splendor whichCary maintains throughout the film, even though he 's supposedly a poorkid from the wrong side of the tracks who left home at nine. Apparentlythere's a finishing school on Skid Row, and Cary was voted BestDressed. Of course, one of the perverse running gags of "Mr Lucky" isthat our hero wears absurdly garish ties, and does not know how to tiea Windsor knot. All he needs is Laraine Day to bring him theappropriate conservative necktie to complete him. Bless him he fightsher off ... On a fifth viewing (over a lifetime), I have to admit thelast twenty minutes drips with melodramatic sentiment out of step withour modern times (hey, I still tear up-don't tell anyone) but this isstill a classic: funny, fast paced, easy on the eyes, and with a greatsupporting cast.
