I was in college when this film was released and it really made animpression on me.  Now, I\'m not saying that it moved me to deepphilosophical thinking.  Rather, this movie is one that can be seen infast-forward mode on your VCR and you won\'t miss a bit of the plot (whichI\'ll give in a bit).  The impression it made on me was one of Lana Clarkson,who plays the lead role, topless and tied to an upright rack while she\'stortured with a needle by a smallish man with large glasses.Now the reason she\'s there:  Amathea (Lana Clarkson) was about to be marriedto the prince of her village when soldiers charge in and slaughter justabout everyone.  The prince is captured and Amathea escapes into the woodswhere she joins up with 3 other warriors.  They plan to go to the city andrescue the prince.  Along the way they manage to kill a few stragglingsoldiers, rescue a woman tied to fence who\'s topless and has been whipped,and make friends with rebels seeking to overthrow the local ruler.Amathea\'s sister allows herself to be captured by the ruler so that she canbe his concubine and Amathea is captured while trying to rescue her.  Theking thinks Amathea is part of the rebel movement and orders her to betortured until she identifies the rebel leaders. After the 5 minute torturescene, Amathea throws the torturer into a vat of acid and escapes, freeingthe gladiators and the prince and creating a mediocre fight scene whereinthe ruler is overthrown and the people are free.Don\'t see this movie for the plot.  Don\'t see it for the dialogue.  You\'llwant to see it because the 4 main actresses in the film eventually have nudescenes in this order: rape, nipple play, wrestling, woman on the fencetopless, rape, stripped topless, Lana\'s torture scene.  The rape scenes areweak, the wrestling is short.  I\'m convinced that the only reason they madea sequel was to show Lana Clarkson on a rack again (see "Barbarian Queen II").Unless you\'re into bad barbarian sword-and-sandle movies, mild rape, LanaClarkson, and/or bondage, you can skip this movie. Me, I saw it for LanaClarkson.
