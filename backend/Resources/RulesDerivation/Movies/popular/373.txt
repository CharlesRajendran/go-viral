This is, currently, the only silent movie I have ever seen, and I wasunsurehow I\'d take it. I had heard a lot about this movie and was expecting bigthings, and I must say I was impressed.The only major complain I have is that, as with many older classics, Ireada review of it prior to buying in which the reviewer gave WAY too muchaway(the ending sequence, namely).. this has happened to me far too manytimes.I really wish reviewers wouldn\'t assume that everyone has already seen themovies they are reviewing, just because they are \'classics\'. It reallydampened my experience with the ending of both this movie, and The ManwithX-Ray Eyes, just to name a few.Anywho, the version I saw (the Kino remaster) was great. The picturequalitywas about as good as you could expect from a film more than 80 years old.The score was very good, maybe a tad repetitive, but it suit the film. Theacting is quite good, very reminiscant of the acting style from themid-to-early 20th century.The scare factor? Well, probably not much these days. The Jewish ghetto isvery well constructed, and really suits the setting. The golem himself isnot so scary, more goofy to me, but to people in 1920, I can imagine hecould have been quite scary. This is more of an \'interest\' movie, than anall-out scare fest. You can really see where so many of the greathorror/scare films over the years got their ideas from after seeing earlyfilms such as this.I would definately recommend everyone who is interested in horror to trackit down. Don\'t be put off by the fact that it\'s a silent film, it took allof 20 seconds for me to forget that completely, and to just enjoy thefilm.
