The shooting of the film on location in Germany is what makes the wholefilmwork and memorable. The story in itself is not really that great, butprobably it grasps our attention because of the surroundings: the ruins,thegloomy statues and the simple and down-to-earth life of the common people.Had it been a Hollywood stage production, there wouldn\'t have been much toit, but once the movie enters Berlin it gets to anotherlevel.The same goes for the acting. Acting among the local population  with onlytwo brought-in American actors in the cast ( the main characters ) musthavebeen an inspiration.
