One of Max Ophuls\' finest achievements,one of the best Guy de Maupassantadaptations for the screen.This is a movie made up of three sketches;it is rather a long story (lamaison Tellier) framed by one prologue (le masque) an an epilogue (lemod√®le).Guy de Maupassant is ,by far,the best writer France as everknown,asfar short stories are concerned-He wrote about 200 of them,and eveninfluenced Dudley Nichols for the screen playof "stagecoach"(actually ,Claire Trevor was Boule de Suif)Le plaisir (the pleasure) is something fleeting,but the hero of theprologue(le masque) can\'t stand life is passing him by.His wife is avictim,women are often sacrified in  Maupassant\'s work.At best they arewaysfor men to social advancement(Bel Ami,see "the private affairs ofBel-Ami",filmed by Albert Lewin ,1947,watchable,but which has given a totally falserendering of the conclusion),at worst ,once their lover or husband hasusedthem ,they are often deserted (see "une vie" , directed by AlexandreAstruc,1958,which has a fine Claude Renoir cinematography."La maison Tellier" is the main body of the work:the subject isscandalous:madam and her whores close the brothel and head for thecountry.There,they are to attend madam\'s niece\'s communion.Max Ophuls hasnot always been faithfull to Maupassant:if you read the short story,youwillrealize how much these women are ugly,vulgar and fat;here ,we\'ve gotgorgeous Danielle Darrieux,plus Ginette Leclerc and MadeleineRenaud.Ophulsis an esthete and he could not subscribe to Maupassant\'s depictions.Thetwomen come together when it comes to describe the reactions of theinhabitantsof the village:the prostitutespass  for grandes dames,well educated,chic,and when they enter thechurch,itseems as if they enhance the religious fervor !!Maupassant,who wasanticlerical to a fault,lets his irony flow;but there\'s compassion in MaxOphuls\'pictures and I\'m not sure the tears his heroines shed are that muchlaughable:regaining a child\'s soul -particularly on this communion day- ismany a human being\'s secret longing.But cynism get the upper hand quicklyand madam\'s brother,a bawdy Jean Gabin (the father of the little girlmakingher communion),is much more interested in  his sister\'s "residents" thanspiritual elevation.This second part climaxes the movie,with itssteam-powered train,its banquet,its brothel of which the shutter areclosed-we\'re only allowed to have a glimpse behind them-The movie opens and closes the same way:woman is born to be deserted whenshe\'s not a whore,like in the second sketch.Josephine (Simone Simon) willfind her lover back but the price she will have to pay isterrifying.Why "le plaisir" ?Pleasure is few and far between in this world.Pleasurewalks hand in hand with suffering.Guy de Maupassant himself knew fleetingpleasures he describes in part 2,but if you read his biography,you \'llmeeta tormented soul,an extremely pessimistic mind,and a  faux bon vivant wholived a dissipated life which ended in madness.This is one of the most absorbing,ambitious,complex and artisticallysuccessful masterwork of the French fifties.
