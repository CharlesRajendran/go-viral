Please, please, somebody get this superb movie on North American DVD orVHS. We need this film at Christmas time and always. Straight from theheart to the heart. To add even greater meaning to this fabulous treat,do some research about the symbolism of the holly and the ivy andconsider the lyrics and tune of the Christmas carol. Personally, I\'vealways thought of the two wonderful aunts as representing the holly andivy of Christmas lore, probably with the priest\'s sister being theholly and his sister-in-law the ivy. Of course, they represent muchmore than the masculine and feminine principles: poorness vs richness,bitterness vs gratitude, disappointment vs hope, negative vs positive,pessimism vs optimism. All of these oppositions are worked outbeautifully by the perfectly cast and capable actresses playing theaunts. A masterpiece!
