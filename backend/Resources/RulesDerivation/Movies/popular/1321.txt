While not an exact remake of 1943's "Hello Frisco Hello", 1945's "NobHill" borrows heavily from the earlier film, and the opening streetscene is film footage lifted directly from the earlier film right downto the song "San Francisco" as the soundtrack.The basic plot is the same: Barbary Coast ruffian thinks he can crashhigh society on Nob Hill. Well, it's not the first time that a moviescript got remade, and with WW II budget constraints, you really can'tfault 20th Century Fox for taking some economies. At least they made itin Technicolor.I also understand that WWII created a shortage of leading men, so thelead in this film went to George Raft, about age 50 at the time thisfilm was made, well beyond draft age. However, considering the movieparts he played, he is suitable to portray a saloon keeper. AlthoughRaft did some dancing in his film career, and also in a film a yearprior to this (Follow The Boys), he is not given any dance performancein this film. Nor does he do any singing, although they could havedubbed him as they did for others. Well, perhaps a singing George Raftwould have been too far away from his on-screen persona. All of the musical performance in this film is given to Vivian Blaine.Since she portrays the entertainer at the saloon, the musical segmentsmake some sense. They showcase Blaine's fine singing (no dubbing neededhere). As a redhead in this film, Blaine is lovely in Technicolor.Blaine is given two new ballads to introduce, composed by well-knowncomposers Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh (see IMDb soundtrack listingfor details). It's strange that neither of these songs becamestandards, for they are as good as any other songs written by thecomposers, and good as others from 20th Century Fox movies of the time. Blaine also has three production numbersÂ—all using older songs: "On SanFrancisco Bay" (1907); the perennial "What Do You Want To Make ThoseEyes At Me For" (1916); and the third, "San Francisco, The Paris of theU.S.A." (1912). Although it's not on VHS or DVD, this film comes up on Fox MovieChannel's schedule from time to time.
