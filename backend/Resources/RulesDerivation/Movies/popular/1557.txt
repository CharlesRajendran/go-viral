A Canadian friend turned me on to this film. Prior to that - about 10 yearsago - I had never heard of it. I managed to find a video and watched it.This was, without question, one of the funniest flicks I had ever seen.Filmed in glorious black & white and mostly at night, it boasted someincredible character actors and a non-stop action plot involving whiskey.LOTS of whiskey. Some great cinematography and sets, moody typical-Englishfog-laden atmosphere  and a giant A for effort what the townsfolk went thruto hold on to that liquor! Very funny, non-violent movie just for laughs. Istrongly suggest you see it.
