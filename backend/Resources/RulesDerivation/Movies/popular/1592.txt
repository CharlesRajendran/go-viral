Jack The Giant Killer is a unique film in its own right.  Personally, Ithink it is a far nicer film than The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (although Istill have fond memories of that film, rest assured)and its one that Ienjoywatching again and again and again.  All the cast (Kerwin Matthews, JudiMeredith, Torin Thatcher, Anna-Lee, Walter Burke, Don Beddoes, et al) givefine performances and the special effects (most notably, the stop-motionanimation, the cartoon-style animation) stand up well to the test of time.The story is nice and straight forward and easy to understand.However, for me it is Judi Meredith who really made the film.  The sceneswhere Pendragon (Torin Thatcher) uses that jewelled staff to turn her fromabeautiful, kind princess into a beautiful, cold and icy witch had a realeffect on me when I saw the film for the first time on BBC1 in the summerof1976.  Even more effective was when she showed Jack (Kerwin Matthews) herreflection as a wicked witch in the mirror and said "Gaze upon my trueform.Am I not beautiful?"  then she laughed an evil laugh!  It was good thatJackmanaged to break the spell afterwards.  On the other hand, I wish I couldhave seen a little more of Elaine as a witch, in this film.I had no idea that this film was released as a musical until a few yearsago.  I haven\'t seen the musical so I cannot really comment on it.However,perhaps it\'s just as well as I have heard that the musical numbers arelousy.  I saw the film again on Channel Four at Christmas 1997 and it waswonderful to see it again.Jack The Giant Killer offers an enjoyable story, great action scenes,competent direction, great special effects and a professional cast.  Its amust for anybody who likes fantasy films.MATTHEW HYATT
