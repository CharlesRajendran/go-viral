Paris is plagued by a murder spree. French reporter Pierre LaSalle (DarioMichaelis) is hot on the trail of what he thinks is a vampire killing offyoung strippers. LaSalle is also being courted to his dismay by hisex-lover, Giselle du Grand (Gianna Maria Canale - Goliath vs the Vampire),granddaughter of the mysterious Duchesse du Grand. Meanwhile, across townatthe Institute of Experimental Surgery, the Duchesse is working withprofessor Julien du Grand (Antoine Balpêtré) to help develop artificialblood. Soon enough, reporter LaSalle gathers enough clues to confirm hiscrazy theory, and soon learns the truth about the Duchesse, the professorand even Giselle.This film is the foundation of the short-lived Italian gothic horrorsub-genre. Containing much of the elements of the classic American horrorfilms of the 40s (dimly lit corridors, musty dungeons, mad doctors,rottingskeletons etc), this atmospheric production didn\'t do well in Italy. Onlyyears later, after the success of the Hammer Studios (England) gothichorrorrevival, was this movie rediscovered and appreciated for what it was.Director of photography Mario Bava (Black Sunday, Lisa and the Devil)givesa great look to this Elisabeth Bathory-inspired tale, using low angleshotsand highly contrasted lighting. Bava also took over direction when Fredaleft the set halfway through production. Look for a young Paul Müller(Nightmare Castle, Bram Stoker\'s Count Dracula) as the hiredkiller.
