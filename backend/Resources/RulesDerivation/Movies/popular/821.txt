This gritty film, exposing the world of small time crooks in London, is areal masterpiece of film noir.  The director, Jules Dassin, has capturedthis dark, dirty world perfectly and the black and white cinematography issuperb.  Richard Widmark is as despicable here as he was as Tommy Udo in"Kiss of Death"...it is a coup of casting.  Francis Sullivan as Phil isgreat as the nightclub owner for whom Widmark shills and Googie Withers, oneof my favorites of British film, is awesome as the unfaithful wife.  GeneTierney is wasted as Widmark\'s girlfriend...she does not seem to have muchto do.  Other support players are strong and you get to see Herbert Lomwithout his toupee!  This is one of the best in the film noir genre and theending pulls no punches. This is not a happy, feel good film.  Highlyrecommended.
