This is a movie for those seeking their truth. It is about a period in thelife of Gurdjieff and his struggle (and obsession) to find himself.Investigating philosophy, religion, science, spirituality, he finallycomesto a point (at the end of the movie) of being at peace with himself and onhis path. I found it to be a remarkable film, and, at the end, inspiringanduplifting.
