Whisky Galore AKA Tight Little Island is one of the funniest movies I haveever seen. Alexander MacKendrick did a fantastic job in bringing ComptonMacKenzie\'s book Whisky Galore to the big screen. MacKendrick keeps thepacegoing with plot twists that would cause one to "bust a gut."  If you arelooking for a truly enjoyable movie to lighten your mood, Whisky Galore isamust.
