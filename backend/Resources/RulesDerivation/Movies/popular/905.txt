Although it could have done with a larger dose of atmosphere, and muchless comic relief and romance, this is still a highly engaging classicfilm, with a number of thrilling moments and interesting ideas to keepit moving along. James Mason is excellent, even if sometimes a bitover-the-top, convincingly playing a character twice his age in reallife. The photography is quite magnificent, with glides and panseffectively distributed throughout. The characters are generally goodtoo, and in fact, there is little to complain about with thisproduction. Lockwood\'s performance does lack conviction though, butalmost everything else is great in this film about life, death,superstitions and more.
