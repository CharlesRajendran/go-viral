What a perfect film for insomniacs. This is wonderful to watch with thelights out. With that said, let\'s look at this underrated work by directorAnthony Mann.First the obvious...John Alton is a genius.  The lighting, or lackthereof,is visually striking.  What this man could do with a $10 budget was simplyamazing.  Secondly, let\'s note the unusual commentary/narration by AcademyAward winner(she won the award that same year for her role in "KeyLargo"),Claire Trevor.  I can count only a couple of film noir in which thevoice-over is done by a doomed (in love)woman.  Her sense of entrapmentperfectly encapsulate\'s the mood of this film. Now, let\'s also note theodduse of a theremin for the bulk of the music used in this film.  Check itout...very creepy.  But one of the most overlooked components in this filmhas to be the hulking visage of Raymond Burr.  This guy had to be in justabout every film made between 1944 and 1960.  In this particular film heisa sado-masochistic pyromaniac.  In just about every scene he is torchingsomebody, whether it be by using his lighter, or throwing a flamingflambeaus at some poor unsuspecting party-going girl or by just burningdownhis own apartment. He\'s a nutcase...but a joy to watch on the screen.Okay, so the story itself isn\'t the most original.  But with everythingelsethis film has going for it, I HIGHLY recommend anyone even slightlyinterested, to go buy it NOW!  It\'s one of my absolute favorite filmnoir\'s.Oh...I almost forgot.  Check out Marsha Hunt in this film.  She\'sstunning.
