This film is an updating of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Thefilm updates the action to post-war France, with Orpheus (played byJean Marais) a famous but dis-satisfied poet. The film focuses on the themes of love and death. Most notably Orpheusfalling in love with a glamorous incarnation of Death (Maria Casares). Writer-director Jean Cocteau turns the everyday world into a magicalrealm. Mirrors turn to pools which are portals to other worlds, carradios pick up coded messages from Death\'s World. In less talentedhands than Cocteau\'s, the delicate fantasy could have easily becomeridiculous but he handles it with brilliance and the film worksperfectly.Here Cocteau creates a truly poetic film. The story is magical andentertaining and the film is filled with wonderously surreal images(particularly striking is the frequent use of filming an actionperformed backwards, and then reversing it which creates a very strangeimpression).
