When this picture came out in '62 or '63, Mom took us 3 kids to see itat an old-style huge screened theatre. The titles of the movies(Bert I.Gordon's "The Magic Sword" was the other one) suggested to Mom thatthese were quaint, Disney-like fantasy films, so she figured we weresafe from anything hideous. At the bursting from his elf disguise bythe first monstrous giant in the movie, Mom realized she had made aboo-boo and suggested that we should seek milder entertainment. Ourdesperate protests put the wet blanket on poor Mom's wishes, and we satthrough 2 film adventures that, to this day, are among our all-timefavorites. As I understand it, this picture was produced to cash in onthe tremendous success of "7th Voyage Of Sinbad", and the legaltroubles that resulted from the vast similarities between the two filmswere the reason that the owners of the movie's rights were required todowngrade it into a ridiculous musical version. Thankfully, after yearsof being unavailable, the original untouched "Jack" came out on video,and it was about as much fun seeing it again as an old codger as it wasas a 10-year-old.For us "baby boomers" who started out on black-and-white TV and seeingsuch films as "King Kong", etc., when we were young, a stop-motionanimated monster is just more scary, other-worldly,dangerous...whatever term fits an effective creature feature. AlthoughKerwin Matthews' many nemeses in "Jack The Giant Killer" don't quitestand alongside Ray Harryhausen's magnificent work, they still makethis film well worth seeing for anyone who enjoys a good, old-fashionedmythical adventure.Incidentally, if you have an idiotic sense of humour, the musicalversion is a scream to behold- especially the sequence of the evilwizard's servant returning to his master to report a failed kidnapping.:D :DEveryone certainly has their own taste in motion pictures, but as faras this old monster movie watcher is concerned, "Jack The Giant Killer"is among the upper crust of its genre. Even after 31 years.I'll say 8.5/10. God bless one and all...
