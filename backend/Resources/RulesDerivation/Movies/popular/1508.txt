I\'ve just seen this movie with several german friends and, although myGerman is really poor and there were no subtitles (only a good friendhelping me to understand it), I found it quite a sweet classic film which Ifeel really happy to have discovered. The simple and yet funny story aboutaman that "returns" to childhood in order to make all sorts of jokes to thegrownups is just so well carried out that, despite not even beinggerman-speaker, can be easily watched with a smile on the face. Sureenough,most of the jokes can\'t be understood for non-german speakers (andsometimesnot even for german themselves!) but the performers play sincerely greatroles and at many times a face is worth a thousand words. To sum up, a filmI would like to see once again (I hope next time with subtitles, at least;)and quite a cult-movie in its home country, where many people watch it as atradition once a year... It\'s tender, it\'s sweet, somehow na√Øve... Einewuenderschoene Filme, wuerde ich sagen!
