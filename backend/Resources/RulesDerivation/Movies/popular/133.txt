"Time After Time" is an interesting movie.  It has the legendary H.G. Wellschasing Jack the Ripper through time, from London in 1893 to San Franciscoin 1979.  Wells is played by Malcolm McDowell, as a young idealisticvisionary and scientific genius, who looks upon the future as Utopia. (Howmany movies can you remember where McDowell was the good guy?) Jack theRipper is played by David Warner, who exudes something cold and frighteningas the infamous killer.  While the future hardly turns out to be Wells\'imagined Utopia, Jack embraces the prevalent violence of the 20th century. In "From Hell," Jack the Ripper said he had invented the 20th century. "Time After Time" gives that statement a kind of significance.  The moviemay not offer much to the many theories surrounding the Jack the Rippermystery, but it\'s still enjoyable.
