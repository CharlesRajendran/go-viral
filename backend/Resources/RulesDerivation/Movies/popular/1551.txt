 From the opening score and scenes of the water, I was drawn to watch thismovie.  It was filmed somewhere in the Caribbean and the location wasbreathtaking.  George C. Scott was perfect in the role of Tom Hudson, anErnest Hemingway-ish character who was a complicated, lonely artist andexpatriate who sculpted, drank, and fished his life away.  It wasn\'t untilthe tragic end that he came to know what he\'d been missing.The music score was haunting and beautiful.  I was so impressed with it thatI ordered the soundrack.
