I was pleasantly surprised watching this comedy for a number ofreasons. First, it was not as low budget and amateurish as I expected.It was actually a quite respectable B movie with make-up, sets, stuntsand camera-work that matched the level of W.C. Fields and Laurel andHardy features of the time.Second, Buster Keaton\'s short role prefigured the third banana roles hewould play in the American International Beach Movies of the 1960\'s.His on-screen time is less than five minutes, still, I suspect he had alot more to do with the production of the movie than his bit part wouldindicate. The gags have a Keatonesque quality. For example the endingscenes of the women chasing men are reminiscent of the ending scenes inhis "Seven Chances." The world of Dogpatch has a self contained, parodyof the intellectual world quality, as does many of the comedic worldscreated by Keaton (See his "Three Ages" for example.The humor in the movie foreshadows the hillbilly humor of the 1960\'stelevision series, "The Beverly Hillbillies." A recent Lucille Ballbiog movie suggested that Keaton had played a major part in the successof the 1950\'s television series "I Love Lucy." If Keaton did play arole in designing some of the gags in this movie, one might suggestthat Keaton was in some sense responsible for a great deal of thesuccessful comedies of the 1950\'s and 1960\'s.On the other hand, the producers might have hired them only becausethey liked his silent film work and he might not have had any input tothe film other than his two or three days on set in his bit part. Iwonder if anybody else has any information about the role Keaton playedin this still charming movie.
