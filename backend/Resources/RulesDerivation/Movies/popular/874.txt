Bernard Shaw does not perhaps adapt too well to the screen, but, in myopinion, this adaptation is particularly successful and probably the best ofthem all, although one video edition in the UK didn\'t even risk mentioningShaw\'s name anywhere on the box, prefering to market it as mere exoticspectacle. It is of course all that, but as with everything Shaw wrote,much, much more, and is essentially about IDEAS, (not necessarily, as hasoften been contended, always Shaw\'s own personal convictions). Vivien Leighas Cleopatra gives yet another sublime and first-rate performance as sheprogresses from frightened teenager to an imperious Queen with a realunderstanding of power. (The scene in which she whips a hapless slave inorder to experience the "thrill" of total power, strangely pre-echoes thepsychology of the much misunderstood SALO). Mention too must also be made ofthe superb musical score by Georges Auric, and admiration expressed for thesheer audacity of producer Pascal for making such a lavish and expensiveproduction in poverty-stricken post-war Britain. Well worthwatching.
