This one was a true nail biter.  I was on the edge of my seat the entiretime.  Mr. Robinson\'s performance was believable and Ms. Bennet wasbeautiful and just as realistic as two people desperate to cover up a crime.This is a film that I highly recommend.  It\'s suspenseful and dramatic.  Ifelt as though I was on a roller coaster ride and couldn\'t get off. Inshort, I was a nervous wreck wondering how this film would play out. Ihighly recommend this one.  I almost passed it by but I am eternallygrateful that I didn\'t.  Rent it, buy it, but by all means, watchit!!
