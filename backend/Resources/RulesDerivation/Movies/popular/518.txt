This postwar movie was one of Clark Gable\'s last for the studio that madehim a star--MGM. Gable is older, perhaps wiser, but here fully capable ofplaying this role with all of the insight into life that his 49 years haveearned him. One has the feeling that after the great \'30s roles such asRhett Butler, after the death of Carole Lombard, and after the war, Gablewas perfect for the world-weary professional gambler that he playshere--thepart fits him like a glove. And he\'s surrounded by great character actorssuch as Frank Morgan, Lewis Stone, and Mary Astor, to name a few.I don\'t agree with the other review that said this was a totallyunrealistic, if watchable film: I grew up in a small city that had agambling house similar to the one depicted here. It was well run, had manyregulars, and was quite well known to the authorities. In any case, thismovie is well worth a view, if you\'re not a Gable fan, you might be afterviewing this one.
