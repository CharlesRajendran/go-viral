I saw this movie in 1951, when I was seven years old. Because severalscenesremained engraved on my mind, years later, when I recalled those scenes, Iwas able to identify the stars (Tyrone Power and Ann Blythe). Heaven knowshow I remembered the name of the movie. I am DYING to see it again becauseof the powerful impression it made on me as a little girl. I scour the TVGuide regularly, but so far no luck. Does anyone have any idea who ownsthismovie? I keep hoping Turner will find it in some lot of films he buys andshow it on his TCM station.
