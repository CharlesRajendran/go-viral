French comic actor Fernandel embodied the title role while remarkableItalian character actor Gino Cervi played his spiritual and politicalopponent. More than a rustic comedy, the film epitomizes the postwarpolitical polarization in Italy and symbolizes the famous "compromessostorico"---historical compromise---under which Italy would long continue tobe governed. This successful film spawned a series of popular sequels,mostly with the same two actors, all based on the Giovanni Guareschinovels.A point of clarification: this was a French-Italian co-production and wasfirst released in the U.S. in its French-language version with Englishsubtitles before the dubbed English version with narrator Orson Welles wentinto circulation.  The Italian-language version, not readily available, isthe most appropriate one.
