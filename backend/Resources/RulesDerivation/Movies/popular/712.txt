Stars are the primary reason for me to watch old movies, because they justdon\'t make them like that anymore. \'Bowani Junction\' provides some of thebest; Ava Gardner is so irresistibly attractive in this movie thatwatchingher along is worth every penny spent for buying the copy. Better yet,otherthings in the film are also good.   Granger, playing a more realisticrole,is at his best elements as a daring arrogant English Col., match nicelywiththe beautiful Gardner as a romantic couple.   Most of the Indiancharactersare well portrayed and I love movie with a  historical background .  Thestory is complicated ,yet well told and paced. The characters areinteresting and well presented. Over all, this is Cukor\'s movie at itsusualfine standard.This one is not to miss for fans of Granger, Gardner, and Hollywoodoldies.
