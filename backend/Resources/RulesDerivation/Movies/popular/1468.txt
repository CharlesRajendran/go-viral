It's too bad that this film is unavailable in the United States. Manyyears ago it was given to me by a friend who taped it off some obscurebroadcast station. I've shown it every year since and have never growntired of it. There is much truth in this film, and all of itscharacters reveal something of themselves that we can all identifywith. And what a cast-- Ralph Richardson, Celia Johnson, MargaretLeighton, Denholm Elliot, and Hugh Williams! Richardson's parson isone, regardless of one's faith, we would all love to know. And Johnsonand Leighton display acting of the highest order. Elliot is superb asthe restless son, and Williams as a world weary but understanding andcompassionate friend of the family has never been better. This is afilm that deserves wide attention and should be a Christmas staple. Itis not only my favorite Christmas movie, but also one my ten favoritefilms of all time.
