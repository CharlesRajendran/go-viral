Yes, 9 stars from me, certain I am! This version\'s my favoritetreasure-hunt-pirate movie, it ought to be on DVD just as it is, notcolorized. I know, Beery\'s basically the same guy he played in most ofhis talkies. But someone at MGM had a flash of casting genius cuz Beeryis the spittin\' image of the Sea Cook in Winslow Homer\'s illustrationsfor the novel, and he wears the role like his favorite pairof--um--shoe. And even if the only English accents seem to come fromNigel Bruce (most prominently) and (who else? can\'t recall), somehowthis cast makes their variety of UnitedStatesian accents work. Theypull it off. There are a few differences between the novel and thismovie version, but darn few and so what. There\'s no shortage of remakes& won\'t be. I\'ll take this version! Saw it on TV three or four times inmy teen yrs, having read the novel when I was 12, and the differenceswere never significant to me. I\'ve seen Disney\'s, which I liked on theDisneyland telecast, but, while Robert Newton is a definitive Long JohnSilver and the quintessential adventure-tale pirate--people today sayArrrr! because of his performance--Bobby Driscoll\'s Jim Hawkins neverquite did the job in my opinion. (And Jack Palance is another greatactor and his Long John Silver terrific but the version he\'s in isembarrassingly bad. Haven\'t seen the Charlton Heston.) Gotta go withthis MGM version, Jackie Cooper\'s pout and all (but does Cooper havePresence!). From the opening scene, in which we are introduced to JimHawkins and Billy Bones (Lionel Barrymore having the time of his life!and setting the standard for the rest of the cast), and the unfoldingstory giving us as motley & mangy a bunch of pirates as everwere--among them Charles McNaughton as Black Dog, Charles Bennett as acreepy Dandy Dawson, Douglas Dumbrille as Israel Hands, and "Chic" Saleas loony Ben Gunn--to the last frame of the last scene this is adownright exciting adventure, and I think it does Robert LouisStevenson proud (yep, even w/the minor differences). To your kids: Isuggest finding an edition of the novel w/ Winslow Homer\'sillustrations, read that first, cuz there\'s nothing like the original,with justright illustrations for a bonus, and your imagination. Thensit your parents down & watch this MGM version with \'em. You\'ll have afine family evening. Yes, you will, sez I!! Now get me a noggin\' o\'rum!!!
