A very good movie about The Day, a newspaper publishing its lasteditions, and its aggressive attack on a known mobster. Humphrey Bogartdoes an excellent job as the editor, and Ethel Barrymore gives awonderful, regal performance as the widow of the publisher, whosedaughters are now demanding that the paper be sold to a competitor.The film brings up, a mere 53 years ago, issues that are relevant today- the tabloids versus real, factual news, and the meaning of a freepress. These debates continue today, but unfortunately, it seems thatthe tabloid type of journalism is winning. As for a free press - ourpress might be freer than many, but it isn\'t entirely free. As anyonewho lost money in the great savings and loan scandal can tell you,important stories disappear from the front pages all the time.Bogart\'s strong performance is the engine that keeps this film going,and there\'s a nice performance by Kim Hunter as his ex-wife. DeadlineUSA reminds us of the good old days, when you could believe what youread in the New York Times.
