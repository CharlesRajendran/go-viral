My favorite Richard Widmark performance on the screen and probably hisbest work is Night and the City. This was director Jules Dassin's lastfilm before settling in Europe in the wake of the blacklist and it hasa first rate cast tuned to a fine pitch, like an orchestra without abad note in it.Harry Fabian is this smalltime American hustler/conman who's settled inLondon and always working that middle ground netherworld between thelaw and outright gangsterism. He really isn't a very likable man andthe trick is to keep the audience care what's happening to him. This isthe test of a great actor and Widmark is fully up to the challenge.Fabian while working one of his cons overhears a piece of informationabout the father/son relationship between champion Graeco-Romanwrestler Gregorius the Great and gangster/promoter Cristo who is theLondon version of Vince McMahon. He cons Gregorius into thinking hewants to promote old style wrestling like Gregorius used to do. Thatcon game sets in motion the events of the film that ultimately end intragedy.The cast is uniformly fine, but one performance really stands out, thatof Stanislaus Zbyzsko as Gregorius. He was a real professionalwrestling champion back in the day when it was real. Zbyzsko invests somuch of his own life and reality as Gregorius that he's reallysomething special. His scenes with Herbert Lom as his son are so goodthey go far beyond the plane of mere acting. It's some of the best workLom has ever done as well.How there weren't a few Oscar nominations from this is a mystery forme. For those who like film noir, this should be required viewing.Especially for you Richard Widmark fans.
