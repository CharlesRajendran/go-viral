This is a wonderful companion to TROUBLE IN PARADISE, also featuringthe immortal and neglected Kay Francis; it features the great WilliamPowell in one of his most unrivaled moments on screen. Another greatone from Dieterle who also directed the American classic DEVIL ANDDANIEL WEBSTER, which was recently released on DVD. Be nice to see thisother classic of his become available. I viewed this on TCM and wasentranced by the sparkling dialog; I wondered again why this effectseems impossible to achieve nowadays - was it that so many of theseearly actors had honed their talents on the stage? I would like to seethis released on a disc with HIGH PRESSURE, another early Powell.
