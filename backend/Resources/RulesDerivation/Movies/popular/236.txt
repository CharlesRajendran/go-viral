It was only the second year of the Academy but already they were votingpolitically - Jeanne Eagels\' brilliant performance in this creaky earlytalkie had to make do with an Oscar nom and the statuette went to the worstperformance ever to win - Mary Pickford\'s in COQUETTE.   The only existingprint was a work print without music or final editing, but wherever it\'sshown, Eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling, powerful performance.  She is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lyingthrough her teeth (we did after all SEE her kill the man), we in theaudience find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in her innocence, beforewe suddenly catch ourselves.  THAT is GREAT ACTING.    The film needs to bemade available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrificperformance again.  (One silent of Jeanne\'s exists in archive print - MAN,WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost," so this isthe only document we have of her.   Run to see it (when it first came out ofthe archives to be shown in NYC in the early 70s, the Village Voice printeda full page review, worshipping the Eagels performance).
