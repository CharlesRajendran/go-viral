This film will always have a great significance to me because itintroduced me to the beauty of opera. Marjorie Lawrence was a majorsoprano with the Metropolitan Opera, and her career was cut short bypolio while she was still in her vocal prime. Her story is told withgreat sensitivity and warmth. The operatic scenes are done toperfection, with the superb soprano Eileen Farrell doing the vocals.Eleanor Parker is seen here in what must be her greatest work as anactress. Parker was a great, if somewhat under-appreciated actress, andshe was a beautiful woman. Of course, it is she who dominates themovie. Glenn Ford provides excellent support as her doctor husband whoguides her back to her career. When this film was released, I was tenyears old, and kept going back again and again to see it over and over.I loved the music, loved the story, and will forever be indebted to itfor having introduced me to the beauty of grand opera. If I had tochoose a film as the most important of my life, it would have to bethis one.
