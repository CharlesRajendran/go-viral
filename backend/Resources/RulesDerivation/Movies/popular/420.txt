Well-acted, nicely photographed, believable, this near-melodrama isremarkable for its comparatively realistic portrayal of character andpersonality on each side in the Russian Civil War (which immediatelyfollowed the second Russian Revolution, Lenin\'s Bolshevik take-over in theAutumn of 1917).  See it, though, not so much for a surprising insight intocrumbling Soviet ideology in 1976 (so early!) as for a very human, verytouching love story.
