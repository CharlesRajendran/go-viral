I saw this movie TWICE within the same week. Yes I did, believe it ornot, but I do not ordinarily subject myself to such pure torture, butthe main reason was (other than sharing my find with a close friend) -I wanted to count the number of times that the exact same chordsequence and jangling flamenco guitar riff repeated (plus, I keptexpecting a villain to appear from behind the bat-wing doors of an oldwestern tavern). I confess that I gave up and threw my notebook at thescreen after only about ten minutes in. Yet I continued to watch itagain, slowly tugging at my hair, whilst my friend stared at the screenwith his mouth open during the amazingly weird voice-overs that mayhave found a place in a commercial for men's cheap cologne...Okay, it isn't a movie solely about an infinite flamenco guitar motifas it also has someone banging a key or two on the piano here and thereat inopportune moments throughout... I confess that I still heard partsof the soundtrack in my head about three days after I last saw this, sobe careful if you value your sanity.Anyway, it's about a mad doctor who seemingly doesn't even know thedifference between spiders and insects, which is no surprise, really.His experiments, other that making giant mutant spiders that are shyand need to hide behind a folding dressing screen, is producingbeautiful strong women, and very short ugly men. Why the women turn outbeautiful instead of more spider-like (unlike what is implied) isanyone's guess.I would guess that the dance of Tarantella is supposed to be somewhaterotic and I guess it is, in a way, and probably the only thing worthwatching other than laughing yourself sick at Masterson's gleeful starewhilst pretending to be quite mad. (I assume he was just pretending,anyway.)Seriously, if you want to hear an endless flamenco guitar motif thatdeeply embeds itself in your brain forever and ever, this is the one towatch!1/10.
