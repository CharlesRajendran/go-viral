Even though filmed as the second world war came to a close my home countrymanaged to sedate people not on the front yet with this humorousmasterpiecethat is still astonishing 56 years after its release. if it wasn`t for thenazis, this movie with Heinz RÃ¼hmann in his genuine role would have beencelebrated world wide right away. it has all the wit of the \'good side\' ofGerman culture and somehow manages to leave out anything \'political\' by afar cry. just a plain great amusing movie that features infantilefriendshipand adventure and all the fun of being young while never getting rid ofthestains of being a movie people were meant to view to forget the crazy warout there.
