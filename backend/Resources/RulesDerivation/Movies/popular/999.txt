The general consensus seems to be that the first season of this alltime classic TV show was the best and I would probably agree with that.Although, I'm a dedicated fan of the entire series.The injection ofcolor into the closing stages of the production run gave those finalepisodes a special quality of their own.George Reeves was positively born to play the title role. Thepreviously inconsequential journeyman actor brought the character tolife with great conviction, charm and a wonderful enthusiasm whichnever faltered. Of course, he had some fine support with John Hamiltonas Perry White, Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen and Robert Shayne asInspector Henderson.As for the portrayal of Lois Lane, it really depends on which approachyou preferred. Phyllis Coates created a prickly, no-nonsense big cityreporter who wouldn't hesitate to smack 'ya across the face with a wetmackerel if you tried to get fresh with her. Noel Neil was more of yourgood natured girl next door who was always ready with a cheery word anda polite laugh whenever Clarke Kent or Jimmy made a clumsy attempt athumor (which usually backfired).So it's all a bit corny when you look back now from our jadedperspective of life in the present day. But, who cares? It's stillgood, clean fun which is more than you can say for most of the vile,mind numbing garbage that spews forth out of the television these days.And there was a good spirit behind the whole thing ...obey the law,salute the flag, say "please" and "thank you", be kind to your fellowhuman beings, take in stray cats, brush your teeth (and the cat'steeth) twice a day.It was a different era and a better world in some ways.
