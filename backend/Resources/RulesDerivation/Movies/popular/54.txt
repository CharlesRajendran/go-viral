When I saw "On With the Show" on Turner Classic Movies, I was verydisappointed in the poor quality of the picture and the sound, but wasvery pleased by some clever dialog, although realizing some of it wasnot so clever, and I was absolutely in awe of the performance of BettyCompson.She was not only lovely just to look at, in her big scene near the end,she stole the show.She was more than charming -- she was adorable.Joe E. Brown's presence in a movie is usually enough to make me skip itbut here he is toned down considerably, is not so silly, and heperforms an eccentric dance with a surprising athleticism. I actuallyliked him in "On With the Show." Sally O'Neil was surprising. She sounded at first like some precociouschild, with little-girlish voice, but when this caterpillar bursts outof her cocoon, she is a star.One other aspect of this film is almost unique for its time: The castis integrated. Right there on stage are black dancers with whitedancers, although to be accurate there is not interaction between whiteand black. Still, it was a start.Ethel Waters made what was apparently her film debut, and surely was animmediate hit since she was already a star in other media.A 21st century viewer of "On With the Show" must consider context,remember the times in which it was made, during the changeover fromsilents to talkies, to be able to appreciate it fully.There were lots of great individual talents involved, and a viewershould try to ignore the poor framing of the scenes and the poorquality of the sound, at least some of which might be because of theage or even generation of the print.But appreciate the historicity as well as the talent, and you willenjoy "On With the Show" as much as I did.
