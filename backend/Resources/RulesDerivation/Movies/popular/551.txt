I watched this movie by accident, due to a last-minute program changeby the TV station. I had missed the first couple of minutes includingthe title, so I was just as unprepared as the shipwrecked Andrew(Michael York) when he set foot on this beautiful tropical island. Tohis horror, he finds out that an aging scientist, presumed long dead bythe world, has populated the island with his "children," the results ofhis experiments in combining human and animal genes. What I found mostastonishing was the authentic feel to the characters. Starting withAndrew. His initial repulsion develops into a discerning appreciation,without ever condoning the monstrosity of Dr. Moreau\'s project. The oldscientist himself (Burt Lancaster, a rather shallow performance incomparison) is not an evil lunatic but a genius who got carried away,convinced to the end of his own noble goals and best intentions.However, the most amazing aspect is the differentiated portrayal ofMoreau\'s more or less "successful" creatures. The movie manages to makeyour heart go out for them in their struggle to be human against theirnature. The most poignant moment is the Lionman\'s farewell cry for hisMaster. An overall very satisfying movie, despite some weaknesses inthe development of the plot towards the end (it feels like the directorsuddenly ran out of time). Quality science-fiction with goodentertainment value. 7/10
