This is a lost treasure, I saw it a few nights ago on TCM, and wassurprise about the acting and the quality of the movie, script anddirection, and for a change it is not set in New York or Los Angeles,but in Cleveland, Ohio. Gene Tierney was fantastic in this movie. Iwondered aloud why Paramount Pictures have not release this movie onDVD. Gene Tierney is by far one of the most beautiful women ever inmovie history. This is a newer version of screwball comedies, but witha twist, I won't spoil it for you. Here goes what I can tell you, twomother-in-laws, a newly wed couple, a rich spoil kid and a beautifulwoman, got it? That is all I will say, this movie is a charm. Even ifyou don't like screwball comedies, Gene Tierney is worth the time, sheis just great to look at, a very beautiful woman.
