Robert Flaherty is one of the more noted documentarians in the historyof film. It is not without some concentration (ironically maybe) towatch his most well-known work, Nanook of North, which is as muchdocumentary as it is almost the very first widely seen "Home movie".There's no narration aside from the several title cards listing theobvious things that Nanook and his family/tribe are doing in thearctic. Therefore this is much more of a visual kind of documentary, not asoutrageous and experimental as those of Dziga Vertov of the same period(using what camera equipment available, shooting seemingly on the fly),but with a distinct view on what life is usually like for these people.We basically see them doing very elementary tasks, more based on livingday-to-day in this harsh climate than anything overly dramatized. That all of the scenes are really 'staged' (and, apparently, it's noteven Nanook's real wife) doesn't deter the viewer from what is beingshown. It's like a mix of the objective and subjective- objective inthe sense that 'this is what it is, the Eskimos hunting for food,raising their children, making their shelter in igloos, and makingtrips to ensure their survival'. Subjective in that Flaherty's camerais creating a specific view of these people, their faces capturedmemorably in the scratchy print of the film. In a way it's also likethe first, and perhaps more groundbreaking, of the lot of naturedocumentaries to follow over the years, though to a primitive extreme.In all, Nanook of the North is meant to above all show the versatilityof these people, both the physical nature (i.e. hunting the seal, whichis the most exciting in the film) and the nature of the spirit of thesepeople, living this way as a cycle over and over again.
