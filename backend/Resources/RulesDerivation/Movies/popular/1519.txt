Be ready to sit back and be gloriously entertained for 2 hours.  TheHollywood Canteen was a real place that was the idea of John Garfield whoenlisted the help of Bette Davis and they took it from there.  Bette gotJules Stein (head of Warner Brothers) involved and it really took off fromthere.  Then they made the movie, the bulk of the proceeds went to theHollywood Canteen.  The stars just keep on coming and they all put on ashow.  Here is your chance to see them virtually in their prime or headinginto their prime.  Nothing boring here.  Then there is the love storybetween Joan Leslie and Robert Hutton (there was a tremendous chemistrybetween them on the screen).  Sure it would never happen in real life but itcertainly would be every soldier\'s fantasy that it could happen.  And thatwould keep a lot of spirits up in cold fox holes.  I can see why it was sucha success when it came out.  The Hollywood Canteen closed after V-J day.  Ithad $500,000 left in bank account.  That was used to set up a foundation tofund projects for the armed services and it is still goingtoday!
