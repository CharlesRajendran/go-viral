Surprisingly great John Ford film starring Shirley Temple. I was unsure ifIcould stand her cuteness for an hour and forty minutes, but I was never asannoyed as I expected to be. She\'s actually quite - good (I\'ll probablynever live that down, will I?).Once in a while, she got a bit cloying, butfor the most part I enjoyed her performance. Believe me, though, John Fordand his screenwriter were careful to balance her with the rest of the film,which is indeed quite masterful. All of the other performers are pitchperfect, including C. Aubrey Smith, Cesar Romero, Michael Whalen, ConstanceCollier, June Lang, and especially Ford regular Victor McLaglen. He\'samazing, as always. The story, based on a Rudyard Kipling book, is verygood. Lang plays Temple\'s mother. Her husband has apparently died, and sheaccepts the gracious invitation of her father-in-law (Smith), a colonel inIndia, whom she has never met. While there, Temple becomes a sort of amascot of the soldiers, with Sgt. MacDuff (McLaglen) taking care of her andteaching her how to be a soldier. Another soldier (Whalen) courts Temple\'smother. Cesar Romero plays Khoda Khan, a bandit prince who is being heldprisoner in the fort. Ford\'s direction is as exciting as ever, and thecinematography is halfway between the expressionism of The Informer and thenaturalism of Stagecoach. The musical score is also quite good. One mightobject to the colonialist viewpoint of the film, but, to be fair, WeeWillieWinkie is a lot more palatable in that respect than George Stevens\' muchmore famous Gunga Din is. 9/10.
