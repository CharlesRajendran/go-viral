I watched this movie when I was much younger and the last time I viewedit on television was in 1987 -- this is the kind of movie you trackdown, because it is a truly a classic -- Cary Grant\'s and Betsy Drake\'sperformances in this film are so outstanding and so real-life -- He isone comical guy, but sexy too! This movie takes one back to their lifein their early years long ago, when living and even being short onfunds was as brittle as it is today! I really enjoyed this movie somuch, that I hunted it down and finally found it and I watch it all thetime now -- I just love Cary Grant -- one of Hollywood\'s finest! Thismovie proves that, so watch and enjoy viewing the kind of lives peopleused to live and life was honestly worth living!
