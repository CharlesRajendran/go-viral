I grew up on this one, and it\'s one of the few that my family stillagrees on as being hilarious and worthwhile.It\'s about a bunch of wonderfully stereotypical mountain people. Thehero is Li\'l Abner, a strapping big young man who eats "pork chops for\'breakfast, pork chops for\' dinner, and for\' supper, mo\' pork chops." Toquote the opening song, "He\'s the biggest catch in Dog Patch." Theentire plot revolves around the impending Sadie Hawkins race whereeligible gals chase eligible guys to win husbands.The characters are what make it worth watching - Mammy Yokum, whostands about 4\'7" and has a potato shaped nose and rules all with herinexorable will; Pappy Yokum, whose memory is balder than his bald headand who lives his life in happily forgetful delirium, punctuated bymoments of terror brought on by his wife; Hairless Joe, who\'s basicallyjust big and loud and stupid; Lonesome Polecat (brilliantly played byBuster Keaton), who\'s basically just weird and small and stupid; andseveral more. Not quite as quotable as some of the cult classics, butmy dad and I regularly allude to some of the lines - "Look - it\'sGranny!" "I\'se a-comin, Pansy, I\'se awake!" Give this one a chance.It\'s somewhat slow, but worth it.
