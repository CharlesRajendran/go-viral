This movie is humorous, charming, and easily becomes a favorite for thosewho enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serioushistory lessons so I simply accept it as is. Bing, in his usual inimitablestyle, performs quite well as the blacksmith, Hank Martin, who by accidentis transported back to another age, the time of King Arthur. The beautifulRhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank\'saffections although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable SirLancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon.I just love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore(Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up in tattered clothing and taketo the high road with their knapsacks to experience the kingdom atfirsthand. King Arthur\'s comment, "I say, we are not alone" while giving hisscruffy garments a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments in thefilm. William Bendix\'s portrayal is superbly ridiculous, not to mention hisattempts at quaint "ye Olde English." The story is not deep but it\'s well done in my opinion and I enjoy it moreeach time I see it. It\'s great family entertainment too.
