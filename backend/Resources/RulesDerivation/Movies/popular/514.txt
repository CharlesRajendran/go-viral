Spurned by his beautiful fiancée, Oliver decides to take Stanley and jointhe foreign legion.  Once there he finds his fiancée has travelled more thanhim and decides to leave, but it is too late.  The pair go off on trainingbut then the siege of a nearby fort in the desert means they will see moreaction than expected.One of the best things about Christmas is that the TV channels need to fillthe schedules with films etc that feel different from the usual daytimestuff they cram on.  One of the ways they do this is mini-seasons of workfrom various people or themes etc.  One such this year has been Laurel andHardy films and I\'m very glad.  This film was one I hadn\'t seen before butit was very funny.The film has really good set pieces but also a running gag that I didn\'t seecoming so I won\'t spoil it for anyone else. I\'m a big fan so I may be alittle biased but I be surprised is anyone sat through this without laughingat least a few times.  Both the leads are on top form and both have theirlittle things that get me every time  Oliver\'s looks to camera and Stan\'sdouble takes at innocent objects in the background.Overall this is pure gold with hardly a slow moment, even the jokes thatwere signposted as coming (the spring in the chair) made me laugh out loud. Good for fans and non-fans alike.
