There seem to be only a few directors of cinema's infancy whose filmsare worth much attention; Maurice Tourneur is one of them. His filmsmay not always be the most entertaining, but most of them that I'veseen contain something that interests. "Alias Jimmy Valentine", forexample, has major story problems, but the heist scene is outstandinglyfilmed for 1915. Here, too, the allegorical messages (the bluebird ishappiness and such) are too sappy at times, but then there's aninspired shot or something else innovative.The dark, flickering transfer of a deteriorated, bleeding print surelytakes away from much of the visual qualities of this picture, but someof the photography and the color tinting shines through. Tourneur hadsome preparation for the dreamland journey of this film with the dreamclimax in "The Poor Little Rich Girl" of the previous year. The wonderand imagination of a child are well affected. Despite its age, thefilm's best element is still apparent; I think that is its awareness.Perhaps, most obviously, this film is comparable to "The Wizard of Oz"(1939), but more so to the 1914 trilogy, which Baum produced. Theanimal costumes are especially reminiscent, as are the cheap, butnice-looking backdrops and sets. Showing even more awareness are thetrick shots in the way of a Méliès fantasy and the final shot where theboy turns to the camera and directly addresses the audience concerningthe film's parable. So, to an extent, Tourneur overcomes the wear ofage and the kiddy bluntness of the allegory.
