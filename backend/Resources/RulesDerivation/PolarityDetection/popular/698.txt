"Jewel Robbery" is a movie made by grown-ups, written for grown-ups andstarring grown-ups. This one almost qualifies as a costumer as everyoneis in 'evening dress', this being 1932. It aired on TCM the othermorning and I can't tell you what a refreshing break it was from whatpasses for modern comedy.Do you like William Powell? Here he was never more debonair and urbane,not even in his Philo Vance pictures or as Nick Charles. Are youfamiliar with Kay Francis? She was so - what's the word - 'feminine'will do. Yes, that's perfect. And together they were perfect in thisPre-Code comedy which keeps you waiting for the next exchange ofdelicious dialogue.He is a gentleman thief and she is a bored wife looking for excitement,adventure, etc. The story is clever enough but the script is the thinghere. Truly, they don't make films like this anymore. Adam Sandler, youhave no clue, son. This is sophisticated stuff.'Jewel Robbery' is only the 2nd picture I have given a 9 to, and it wasrichly deserved.
