The rise and fall of small-time hustler Harry Fabain is chronicled in thisnoir thriller by Director Jules Dassin.This was Dassin\'s American swansong, completed just before being named byfellow director Ed Dmytryk before HUAK as a "communist," thus endingDassin\'s American career.He brought to "Night and the City" all the technique he acquired over yearsof quality movie making.  Although born in Connecticut and raised andtrained in the US, Dassin\'s work always had the look and feel of hisEuropean counterpart, Carol Reed.The script here is a decent one with surprise turns, avoidingpredictability.   Franz Waxman\'s high pitched score adds excitement to theproceedings and Gene Tierney is a creditable second lead.Yet it\'s Richard Widmark on whose shoulders the success of this filmultimately rests.  It\'s not an easy role, as Fabian\'s character runs thegamut of emotional range as he struggles to wheel and deal his petty schemesamongst assorted lowlife types.Widmark proves he\'s well up to the challenge, creating a strong portrait ofa small time hood striving for positive payoffs through his callouscleverness. It\'s a reminder of how talented and resourceful this actor is, and how heand Dassin meshed to create a film of impact.Dassin, of course, went on to France after this to engage in a fabulousEuropean period, while Widmark struggled to find scripts worthy of hisformidable talents, which turned out to be few and far between.
