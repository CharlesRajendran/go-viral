Bette Davis works her usual magic with a colorless role as a wealthysociety matron whose miserable husband wants her to give him a divorce.Film's best moments are the flashbacks to the couple's happier times,which are filmed in a dreamy, surreal manner. Jane Cowl gives anoutstanding supporting performance as an elderly woman attracted togigolos, but the centerpiece here is Davis, and she's magnetic asalways. Filmed just before "All About Eve"--but released afterward--thepicture benefits greatly from the shadowy cinematography, but thepacing plods a bit. Not a bad melodrama, but one that is nevermentioned when film-historians revisit Davis' illustrious career. **from ****
