Bob Greene of the Chicago Tribune has called this the best journalismmovieever made. He is absolutely right.If you are interested in art movies, see Citizen Kane. If you areinterestedin screwball comedy, check out His Girl Friday. If it\'s history you\'reafter, watch All the Presidents Men. If you want to see a classicjournalismmovie, rent one of the multiple versions of The Front Page.But if you want to see a movie that actually shows you what life is likeinside a newsroom, how reporters work together to get a story, and how"thestory" is not always about the big expose but sometimes just about gettingthe little details right, this is your movie.You can also watch Ron Howard\'s The Paper, but it\'s a pale imitation ofthismovie.Unfortunately, this movie is not available on video or DVD. Keep an eye onAmerican Movie Classics or one of the other cable channels, though, sinceitis regularly featured.
