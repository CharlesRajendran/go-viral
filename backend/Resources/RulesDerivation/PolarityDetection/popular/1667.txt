Just when you start to think this film isn\'t as bad as it sounds, it getsasbad as it sounds. It doesn\'t bother me that there\'s more stock footagethanthere is new footage, but it does bother me that they used the same stockfootage clips two, three, & four times each! The narrator is integratedintothe storyline verbally, but of course can\'t be integrated into thestorylinephysically, because the stock footage which comprises the main storylineisbased on a 20 year old (at the time) silent movie! To get around thisminorproblem, the narrator takes the role of a voyeur. He\'s constantly hidinginthe bushes, "observing" others (who of course can\'t see him because hisfootage won\'t be shot for another 20 years or so after they finishedfilmingtheir part). The narrator rambles on constantly about why he didn\'t take ashot at the lions who were trying to eat humans, or why he didn\'t do thisordo that. That would be OK, too, but after a while it just makes thenarrator(who\'s the supposed "hero" of the film) seem like a wimp. The real hero ofthe film is a fellow named "Bennett" (actually Tarzan in the silentserial).There\'s lots of loose ends that are never tied up (like exactly whathappened to Bennett, the Voodoo Priestess, & the little Jungle Boy).There\'sseveral fights between the Bad Black Gorilla & the Bad White Gorilla thatare never resolved. They fight, then the narration goes elsewhere, thenthetwo gorillas bump into each other again, act surprised, & start fightingagain. When you mix all this nonsense together, you come out with one GoodCampy Fun movie that must have had an influence on Ed Wood. The "African"wildlife scenes (from the silent serial) are actually pretty good,althoughnon-African animals (like tigers & orangutans) are mixed in just to keeptheviewer guessing at which continent this film actually takes place. I guessmy favorite scene is the one in which Bennett has to save a damsel indistress from a newly discovered animal: a meat eating hippo! A word ofcaution to parents: although this film is certainly good fun for the kids,too, the Something Weird Video version contains several shorts after thefeature, which contain full nudity, which is not stated on the video box.
