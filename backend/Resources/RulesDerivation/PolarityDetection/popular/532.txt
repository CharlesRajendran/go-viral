As the others have said, this surprisingly turned out to be arealistic, antiwar movie. Frederick March gives an Academy-Award-worthyperformance as the jaded fighter pilot, and Cary Grant gives a goodperformance as his rival. Since Hollywood made more pro-war movies thanisolationist movies up to Pearl Harbor, this one was a bit startling,judging from its era and its title. Perhaps that is why it has notreceived its due rewards. Those who have experienced war usually try toprevent its recurrence, and the grim reality of its death anddestruction are shown in this film about as graphically as they wereallowed at that time. I have heard that even Germany's greatest ace inWWI, the "Red Baron," was very disillusioned when he went home the lasttime before his death. When his mother asked him who his friends werein a photo, he told her sadly when each of them had been killed. War isonly glamorous from a great distance and in games. "The Eagle And TheHawk" captures the real essence of so many wasted lives in the LostGeneration and the destruction of prewar civilization.
