This is an incredible rarity- a look at Native Americans from their firstsettling on this continent (basket weavers, slab builders, cliff dwellers,etc.) through the then present day of post WW I.  Richard Dix isexceptionally good in his finest performance as Nophaie, the tribe\'s leaderand Lois Wilson is equally fine as the schoolmarm.  Their inter-racial loveis impeccably handled.   Noah Beery lends his usual charming menace as thevillain.  The screenplay is unique, balancing opposing points of view andthe cinematography is breath-taking.  Had there been Oscars then, I\'d havenommed it for Best Film, Actor - Dix, Direction - Seitz, Screenplay andCinematography.Currently available on KINO Video in an impeccably restored print - addthisto your collection.  A most unique film and worthy ofrediscovery.
