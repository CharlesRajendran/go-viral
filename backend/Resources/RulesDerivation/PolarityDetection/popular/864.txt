Shaw was a wonderful historian with a deadly eye for irony. Claude Rainsbrings off Caesar with withering poise and breezy wit, standing tall abovethe flashing eye of an Egyptian hurricane named Cleopatra (Vivien Leigh).Caesar\'s aide-de-camp is an affable bear of a man named Rufio (BasilSydney), who mainly just keeps his eye on Caesar. Cleopatra is likewisesheltered by her scheming counselor Ftatateeta (Flora Robson), a name thatnot even Caesar can pronounce. Character actor Cecil Parker as Britannusadds quaintness and serendipity to an already splendid alchemy of spottycharacters. The film moves by turns through a narrow skein of classicalhistory as the reliquarian Egyptian world gives way to a streamlined Romanone. Along the way, we witness the contending parties encompassed andentangled in a delightful pantheon of wit, irony, satire, morals, manners,and adventure. Overall, a tremendously facile projection of one ofEngland\'ssharpest satirical voices, G.B. Shaw.
