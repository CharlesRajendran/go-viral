I\'m only just now beginning to realize how silly the plot and some of thecomedy was in this movie.  When I watched it, it was perfectly wonderful,and I smiled all the way through.  Fred and Ginger, of course, are perfect,whether dancing so memorably to the likes of "Isn\'t It a Lovely Day" and"Cheek to Cheek" or pitching woo.  Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, andHelen Broderick kept it moving with their throughly entertaining comedyrelief.  Even almost 65 years after its premeire, it\'s still in tip-topcondition, both in the print and in its impact, on first viewing, at least. (I\'m afraid to watch it again, for fear the impact will bedestroyed.)I\'ve seen almost all of Fred and Ginger\'s pictures since viewing this.  Someare good, some less so, and all have their moments of excellence.  But noneof them matched this one in my mind for sheer feel-goodness.  The ones thatcame closest were Swing Time, Shall We Dance, and The Story of Vernon andIrene Castle and The Barkleys of Broadway, the last two because they hadquite plausible stories, (and in the case of Castle, one based on reallife).  But still, Top Hat is Fred and Ginger at their best, and hopefullywill always stay that way in my mind.
