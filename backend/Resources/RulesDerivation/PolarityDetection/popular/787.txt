Once one gets over the fact that this 1930 adaptation of Herman Melville\'sclassic sea story has an at best tenuous relationship to the novel it\'sbased on, it\'s quite enjoyable. John Barrymore makes an heroic Ahab, andJoan Bennett is fetching as his love interest (yes, I know). WarnerBrotherswent all out with this one, and as Barrymore was still a top leading man atthe time, did a beautiful job with at least the visual aspects of thestory,and the film is at times breathtaking to behold. Alas, they threw away mostof the plot! Such were the ways of Hollywood. Noble Johnson makes for thebest Queequeg I\'ve ever seen, though.
