Other reviewers have described Wagonmaster splendidly.But I would liketo look at it\'s main lead, Ben Johnson.I was 10 when Wagonmaster came out, and by then Johnson had become ahero to us boys in St.Ives,Cornwall.Johnson had worked his way up tothe Travis Blue role the hard way; from being a rodeo man to JohnWaynes sidekick.We were fascinated by his horsemanship in his earlyroles, and were completely sold by his neat act of jumping off a horsewhilst it was still moving.Very soon, every lad at school was BenJohnson, as we charged around on pretend horses. His appeal was in hisdrawl, the measured, laconic delivery he had. His approach was theeasy, deliberate action of a cowboy who was completely honest,trustworthy and dependable. In Wagonmaster he got his break, and withHarry Carey Jnr., formed a memorable parnership. Careys\' exuberancesomehow balances Johnsons nonchalant style, and they epitomize theyoung West, it\'sdangers, hopes and sorrows.You just know, that as longas they are around, everything is gonna be OK.For me Ben Johnson is as much a part of the screen West as any of theWestern stars, like John Wayne and Gary Cooper. There was no one quitelike him, and his roles, small or big, linger in the mind.The elegiac Wagonmaster is his legacy to Western genre
