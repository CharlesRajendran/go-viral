Everyone has seen Public Enemy and Yankee Doodle Dandy, but if you\'re aserious Cagney buff you\'ve got to see this flick.Made in \'33 it is set in that time period.  Cagney gets out of the bighouse and goes legit, if being a paparazzi is legit.The formula is tried and true; with pluck and luck Cagney makes good.The characters are stock, on paper, but the actors breath so muchpersonality into them that they become individuals. Though we know Cagneywill prevail, we don\'t know just how he will succeed, and that is wherethedrama comes from.The pace is quick enough that you wont go to the kitchen for a sandwichwithout hitting the stop button first.Great acting, a good story, a happy ending, bouncy theme music, andthosegreat cars of the 1930s.  What more do you want?
