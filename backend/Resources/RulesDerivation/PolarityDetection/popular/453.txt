   I haven\'t forgotten this movie even though  haven\'t seen it inalmost 40 years.  Tyrone Power plays a man unhappy with his own era inhuman time while being almost obsessed with 18th century England. Somehow, he knows that, due to a lightning bolt or something, he isgoing to trade places with a man from the 18th century.  And he isdelighted at the prospect of being transported to the era of charm,grace, and sophistication and exchange wisdoms and witticisms with suchgreats as Ben Johnson in a London coffee house.  When the time switchhappens, he discovers that the times weren\'t what they were cracked upto be.  The streets are foul.   The coffee shop conversationalists arepompous and depressingly ignorant of certain fundamentals (to a 20thcentury man) of science, geography, and even philosophical essentialsof the dignity of mankind.   And instead of himself being received as aman blessed with advance scientific knowledge, he is perceived to beboth an agent of Satan and insane.  Meanwhile, of course, he meets the alter ego of the woman he knew inthe 20th century and a tender, haunting love story envelops the viewer.
