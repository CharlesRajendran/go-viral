Desperate for Broadway, the traveling troupe of The Phantom Sweetheartmust always go ON WITH THE SHOW!Here is another very early talkie musical, full of excitement for thenew medium, but bloated by too much talk, unexciting songs sung by thechorus with mostly unintelligible lyrics and an overlong running time.The plot deals with the usual frustrations & jealousies that mostbackstage musicals seem to find requisite.The cast includes William Bakewell as the head usher eager to get hissweetheart, box-office girl Sally O'Neill, her chance at the GreatWhite Way. Betty Compson plays the temperamental star and Arthur Lakethe whiny young male lead. Louise Fazenda is the company's eccentriccomedienne, who is given little to do but laugh at inappropriatemoments.The film does have some compensations. Rubber faced Joe E. Brown iscast as the company's brash comic and, as always, he is funny simply tolook at. Best of all, the incomparable Ethel Waters is brought in tosing a couple of songs, including 'Am I Blue?' Miss Waters has noconnection with the rest of the story whatsoever, but just enjoying herfor a few minutes is pure pleasure.
