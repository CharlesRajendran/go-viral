When I - and I assume, most people - think of Pinocchio, we think ofhis nose growing longer when he tells a lie. Yet, that is only onescene in this movie - the first one ever done on this famous fictionalcharacter, I believe.This is strictly a fantasy-adventure story, not a parable or a fullstory about lying, although that obviously is one of the messages.There are several moral messages in here, so it's a worthwhile storyfor kids to see.Sometimes I think these totally-innocent first few Disney efforts(Bambi, Fantasia) are still better than all the stuff they have put outsince.The colorful scenes are another attraction. particularly in thebeginning in the old man's house with all the fancy clocks and toys.That part is better than much of the adventure story, as it turns out.The story lags a bit in the middle and then picks up with a rousingfinish with a big whale. Overall, I enjoyed "Jiminy Cricket" the best and also appreciated thatthey didn't overdo the songs in here: short and sweet, and not thatmany. They don't make 'em (normally) like they used to!!
