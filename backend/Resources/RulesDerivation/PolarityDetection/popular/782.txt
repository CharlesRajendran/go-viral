When Academy Award nominee Joaquim Phoenix was researching Johnny Cash,he mentioned this Columbo episode in particular. Johnny Cash plays aman who is very similar in some respects to his real personality.They're both musicians and singers but that's it. Johnny's character isa recovering criminal who married Ida Lupino's character who is overlyzealous about God and religion. When her character learns of herhusband's straying with younger girls, he decides to off them on theplane but survives. Anyway, I love watching Johnny Cash and Peter Falktogether. I love the scene where Columbo researches parachutes and goesinto the sewing room where the woman thinks she is losing her mind.Anyway, I remember that scene in particular as he tries to figure outhow he did it. In the end, it's just worth watching. It's for JohnnyCash fans especially. He would have been a wonderful actor as well assinger.
