The best musicals offer memorable songs imaginatively staged. "NavyBlues" offers neither. Both composer Arthur Schwartz ("Dancing in theDark") and lyricist Johnnie Mercer ("Hurray for Hollywood") did muchbetter work elsewhere, as did choreographer Seymour Felix ("The GreatZiegfeld").The leads are only so-so. Oomph girl Ann Sheridan looks great andMartha Raye is suitably brassy, but Jacks Haley and Oakie are hardlyAbbott and Costello, and Herbert Anderson is woeful as Sheridan'sromantic interest.Plots are always secondary in musicals, though sometimes they help pickup the pace. Here, a typically thin story line is a good 20 minutes toolong.For all these weaknesses "Navy Blues" has some interesting aspects.The cast features the already rotund Jackie Gleason in his first film.He doesn't have very many lines but you can't miss him as a youngsailor named Tubby. Had this been made a decade later he would havebeen a natural for Oakie's role.More significantly, this is a last look at the United States Navy onthe eve of World War Two. These are real ships and real sailors on thebrink of history.When Oakie and Haley's characters disembark at Honolulu (actually SanDiego), the ship in the background is the USS Curtiss, a seaplanetender that a few months later was damaged at Pearl Harbor. Twenty-oneof her crew were killed on December 7th.Other scenes appear to have been shot on an Astoria class heavycruiser, of which there were six. The following year three of theseships were sunk off Guadalcanal, with great loss of life.Surely many of the sailors parading behind the cast members in theclosing sequence would not survive the war. Few could foresee that inthe spring of 1941, but for us that sad fact gives the film a poignancyits makers never intended.
