4 years before the memorable "Double Indemnity," Fred MacMurray firstteamed with Barbara Stanwyck in "Remember the Night."The story is typical Preston Sturgis-people meeting in unusualcircumstances and falling in love.In this one, MacMurray prosecutes Stanwyck for shoplifting, and sinceit's Christmas time, he takes her home for the holidays. They encountera madcap adventure before settling in his home.Virginia Brissac is memorable in a brief but devastating performance asa cold mother whose veneer tells you immediately what she is like.Contrast this with MacMurray's family, the wonderful, understandingBeulah Bondi as his mother and Elizabeth Patterson, as an alsounderstanding spinster aunt. This film tries to depict that we are whatwe are because of our environment. It alternates in being funny andserious. Stanwyck's hard-nosed character does become gentle right-awaybut that's due to environmental factors.The ending may disappoint you at first but upon further thought thereis hope for our two major characters.
