The film does a fine job with the crippling illness of Lawrence and hercomeback onstage, but most notable are the performances by thestars.Glenn Ford and Eleanor Parker were never better. Just superb.The scene where she tried to commit suicide and Ford stopped her, brokedown, and asked God for help is magnificent and a must-see.Ford and Parker should be well-remembered as excellent actors.
