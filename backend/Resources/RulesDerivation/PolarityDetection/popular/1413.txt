One of my personal favorites of films of the \'40s is this visually strikingversion raising the art of black-and-white photography to new heights. Thesets and costumes and deep-focus photography combine to make even moreabsorbing the story Oscar Wilde tells of the man whose portrait decays as hehimself remains forever youthful. Hurd Hatfield never had a better role andhe makes the most of it. George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, PeterLawford, Lionel Gilmore, George Sanders, Morton Lowry and many otherscontribute to the overall excellence of the acting. The period atmosphere oflate-Victorian London adds much to the slowly growing horror of the tale.Complaints by others on this message board that the film is too slow or tootalky are foolish. If you want action and special effects, see a ClintEastwood or Bruce Willis film--forget this. But as a compelling andpsychological study of a man influenced by evil (personified by GeorgeSanders as Lord Henry), this version is better than any of the others madesince. It\'s chilling, the way Wilde intended, and no one could deliver hiscynical yet witty observations about human nature better than GeorgeSanders. By all means, an outstanding film. Should be required viewing as astudy of the art of black-and-white cinematography.
