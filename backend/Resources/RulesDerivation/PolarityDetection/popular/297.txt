This was the first film directed by Samuel Fuller. The producer wasRobert Lippert, who gave total freedom to Fuller as long as the budgetwas low. The result was a financial success considering the amount thatwas invested and it established the pattern that Fuller's films wouldfollow: low budget, but control of the film by Fuller.If ever a filmdeserved to be called "noir" it is this one. Apart from being filmed inblack and white, but more black than white, it is the story of a man soblinded by love that all through the film you feel his anguish anddesperation. Fuller took the liberty of adding this love story to thetragic life of Robert Ford, who is known up to our days as "the dirtylittle coward that shot Mr. Howard.". John Ireland is a convincingFord, Preston Foster is John Kelley a man that is in love with the samewoman.. Barbara Britton is outstanding as Cinthy Waters, the woman. Sheis beautiful and has an incredibly modern look for a film that was madein 1949, makes you think of Nicole Kidman. She is unreachable to Ford,he knew that as a fugitive their love could not survive, but he did notrealize that as a cowardly killer, even though he was pardoned, thepeople would hate him and the odds would be that she would not accepthim. She was unwillingly the cause of his tragedy.
