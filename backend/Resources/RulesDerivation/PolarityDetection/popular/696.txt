This is one of the raciest films of the 1930\'s.  A married woman is havingaffairs all over the place, and then is willingly seduced by a gallantjewelthief.  The movie just drips with illicit sex - you\'ve got to see this oneto believe it.  Damn the Production Code for stopping films like this!Wavising Kay Fwancis has never been better!
