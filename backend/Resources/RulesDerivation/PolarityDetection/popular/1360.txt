Okay, before I begin, I should point out that cynical people are warnedNOT to watch this little fantasy film. However, everyone else shoulddelight in watching this very simple yet very enjoyable film. Sure,there are a few story elements that just don't make sense--but myadvice is to try to ignore these and keep watching--the payoff makes itwell worth your time.A young couple, John Lund and Gene Tierney, are getting married but areunaware that Lund's mother (Thelma Ritter) is broke and has no place tolive. However, Ritter is very proud and won't admit this or that shedoesn't have the money to look nice for the wedding, so she skips theservice on a pretense. Later, and here's where realism goes out thewindow, she shows up at Lund's and Tierney's apartment and Tierneythinks Ritter is the maid who has come to help her cook for a bigparty! Ritter does NOT tell her who she really is and makes a terrificspread. Only later does Lund come in the kitchen and sees what'soccurred! Now even then, you MUST suspend disbelief because Lunddoesn't tell his wife the truth--he was interrupted as he was tellingher later that night, as she was trying to make passionate love to himand he just forgot! As a guy, I actually can believe this--at leastshort-term, but not for most of the movie! BEAR WITH IT!!! Ritter, oneof the best forgotten supporting players (here in a starring role), isutterly charming as the housekeeper and she is able to do wonders tohelp the young but troubled marriage. How it all works out so perfectlyin the end makes it all worth while (particular with as it involvesLund's boss, played by Larry Keating). A charming film that ispractically impossible not to like!! They don't make sweet and charmingfilms like this any more.
