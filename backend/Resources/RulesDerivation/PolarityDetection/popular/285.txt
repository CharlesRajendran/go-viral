The second and final film Hedy Lamarr and Clark Gable made together.It\'s afun comedy similar to Ninotchka only in its basic concept, not incontext.Hedy Lamarr is just adorable as a staunch communist and we get to see herina variety of interesting outfits, like the uniform she wears as astreetcarconductor, the "parachute" of a Soviet nightgown, and another much nicernightie that she looks impossibly lovely in.  Clark Gable\'s sarcastichumorworks perfectly in this movie and he\'s quite amusing.  There\'s somewonderful comedic violence here and there and a chase sequence as funnyasthe one(s) Hedy did with Bob Hope in My Favorite Spy just over a decadelater.  Felix Bressart from Ninotchka also appears in this one.  Worth alook, it\'s a good time!
