I remember seeing this as a14 year old in England when it was firstreleased. It has stuck in my mind ever since. The combination of GaryCooper's world weary persona, Dimitri Tiomkin's evocative score, thegreat rendition of the title song by Frankie Laine and the powerfulsense of loss and what might have been all combine to make a fantasticcouple of hours. One thought did occur when I watched it again lastnight was how old the characters all were... We take it for grantedtoday that most roles are played by 25-35 year old actors (andactresses)that to see Cooper, Stanwyck, Quinn, Bond etc. brings one upwith start. Lovely film, though, and I look forward to seeing it again.
