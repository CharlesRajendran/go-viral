Mitchell Leisen directed three wonderful movies, one very good one, mayfine ones, and some that weren't successful. No matter what one thinksof the hauteur theory, he was a fine stylist and that's not a bad trackrecord.The three beauties include this one. Also there are "Midnight," one ofthe most glamorous and charming of all screwball comedies, and "EasyLiving." That may have been Jean Arthur at her very best (and mostlovable.) (The very good one, in my view, is "Death Takes A Holiday.")Thelma Ritter carries this one. So, as she might say with a flip of adust rag, "what else is new?" Indeed, she is one of the treasures ofAmerican movie history.Here she is the mother of John Lund, who is not very appealing. She'sas blue collar as blue collar can be. Lund has fallen for and marriedGene Tierney. Her mother is played very stylishly by Miriam Hopkins.Well, which one would you want as a mother? Or a mother-in-law? Thingis, Thelma is mistaken for a maid when she arrives the day of Lund andTierney's wedding and carries on this charade for most of the movie.It's sad, really. That part is rarely played for laughs and it isindeed far more poignant than funny.Larry Keating is good as Lund's ultimate boss. The actor playing hisson is a cipher and looks almost Keating's age.But this is Ritter's movie. Does she steal scenes? Not discernibly,though I've heard her accused of doing that in other films. She stealsthe picture. And our hearts.
