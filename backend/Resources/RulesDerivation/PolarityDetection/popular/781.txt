In one of his rare opportunities to show his acting talent, Johnny Cashplays a gospel artist that has to deal with his shrewish wife (IdaLupino) and his proclivities for dalliances with somewhat youngerwomen. When his wife threatens to expose his infidelities and continuesto hold tight to the purse strings, Cash has no option but to plotmurder...and a dandy one it is.The two-hour episode allows Cash to do what he does well: sing.However, he gets to stretch his thespian legs as he matches wits withthe clever detective.In addition to a bravura performance from Cash, veteran character actorJohn Randolph has a brief but memorable part as a gung ho and slightlydeaf military man.This episode is, most definitely, in the Top 10 of all Columboepisodes.
