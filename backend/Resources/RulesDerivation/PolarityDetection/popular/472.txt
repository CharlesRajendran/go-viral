Sypnosis: Two couples go to a farmhouse for the weekend. One couplegoes out for a picnic and accidentally wake evil spirits. Will theysurvive Within the Woods?Within the Woods(1978) was, as mentioned above, a damn good littlefilm. Sam Raimi definitely knew where he was going with this when hedirected it. Bruce Campbell, of course, delivers, (he never did make abad performance, did he? I mean, he\'s the only reason to watch Herbiethe love bug and Congo...) and Ellen Sandweiss is believable as thetormented Ellen. Scott Spiegel and Mary Valenti perform to the extentof their roles. (I.E. cannon fodder...) It was shot withapproximatively 1,600$ of budget in a three day weekend in Michigan. Itpremiered in August 1979 at the Punch and Judy theatre in Detroitdouble-billed with the Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)The good: This movie heralds the birth of the Evil Force, a Raimihorror staple, along with his crazy camera movements. The makeup by TomSullivan is great for a first feature and the film has enough gorymoments in the latter half. The film was so intense, that even if thesuper-8 projector filled a 1/4 of the screen, the audience actuallyreacted to it!The bad: No available copy (excluding of course Raimi\'s and Campbell\'s)has high quality or sound and is hard as all hell to find. Let\'s hopesome day Anchor Bay closes the deal to release this little gem.Review: 5/5
