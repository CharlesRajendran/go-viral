This movie is one of my favourites of all time. It portrays Julius Caesar inhis later years, not as a lusting powermonger, but as a wise and benevolentdictator...tired of blood and betrayal and wishing for a brighter vision ofhumanity. Claude Raines gives a brilliant performance of Caesar as adreamer, while Viven Leigh perfectly portrays the naieve yet devious youngCleopatra with her usual believability and vigor. No big explosions...nohorrific violence...just a wonderfully entertaining and thoughtful film. Adefinate classic...not to be missed, especially if you are a fan of thecostume and elegance of this period of movie.
