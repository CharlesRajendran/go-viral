This one has the distinct virtue of allowing Thelma Ritter more than a fewbrief scenes and, as her fans will tell you, she\'s the best reason forseeing this well-scripted, smoothly directed comedy ofmanners.The beautiful Gene Tierney and handsome John Lund make a convincinglyin-love married couple, though this role probably sealed John\'s fate as a"stuffed shirt" in the roles he later accepted.  Miriam Hopkins isdevastatingly effective as a wretchedly spoiled woman and Larry Keating isjust fine as a feet-on-the-ground boss.If you can catch this one, its dated elements shouldn\'t detract from a veryenjoyable viewing experience.
