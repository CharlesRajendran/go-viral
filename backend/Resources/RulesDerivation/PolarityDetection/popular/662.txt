A really well done piece from two top notch stars, three years before theywould be paired again as one of film noir\'s classic doomed couples inDOUBLEINDEMNITY.  After working on this film, Stanwyck gave Sturges an automatic\'Yes!\' when he asked her to be in THE LADY EVE.  MacMurray and Stanwyckwould be paired in two others, THE MOONLIGHTERS (a western in 3-D, no less)and the soapy THERE\'S ALWAYS TOMORROW, but REMEMBER THE NIGHT is their bestromance, both of them bringing a fast patter and no nonsense attitude totheir characters that is both winning and believable.  There are somecharming Christmas scenes when they reach his home - a square dance, a deargift giving sequence and some great supporting work from Beulah Bondi,Sterling Holloway and Elizabeth Patterson.  However, I think the previouscomment hit it on the nose - it\'s as close to a noir holiday comedy as youcan get.  Highly recommended to get you into theholidaze...MDMPHD
