I first saw 'A Date With Judy' at the Radio City Music Hall in lateAugust 1948 when I was eight years old.....what an epiphany!!! Yearslater I revisited the film via television...how could it ever holdup...but...it remains a total charmer!! Music via Powell is lovely,Elizabeth is breathtakingly beautiful...and charming.....then there isthe rest of a super cast...Wallace Beery, Robert Stack, Selena Royale,George Cleveland (the wonderful grandfather from Lassie), ScottyBecket, Xavier Cugat...and lest we not forget, the superlative CarmenMiranda! "It's A Most Unusual Day" ( remember Hitchcock's use of thisas Cary Grant walks through the Plaza just before his kidnapping?),Judaline, Love is Where You Find It" and most memorably of all.."CuantoLe Gusto" (I have murdered the spelling but 'a rose is a rose'!) Supermusic and memories of the radio program and comic book of the samename.This is a delightful musical , and was very successful, in 1948 and isa treasure for today...and it's been released on DVD! It would looksumptuous in Blueray...maybe soon?
