This film, Originally titled BLAZING ARROWS, is the first of several basedupon a Zane Grey novel published only two years prior, and the versionthatis most faithful to the book, while being one of the largest budgetedWesterns of the early sound era, with the viewer advised to remember thatthe period of the narrative (1862) antedated its audience only to theextentthat the Great Depression does to spectators today.  The story tells of acaravan of freight wagons journeying from Independence, Missouri, to theWest Coast during a pre-railroad time, with settlers accompanying, and theprocession\'s four month struggle with hostile Indians, very harsh winterweather, forbidding terrain and renegade betrayal, and is particularlyfullof interesting detail as to the methods of the freightmen and theirmetier.Gary Cooper portrays Clint Belmet, a Missouri guide who has been rearedandtrained as a member of a successive generation of scouts and trappers bytwoveterans of the breed, Bill Jackson (Ernest Torrence) and Jim Bridger(TullyMarshall), who are unaware that their way of life is to be ended by anadvancing intracontinental rail system, only temporarily slowed by the WarBetween the States.  Because of plot circumstances, Belmet must pretend tobe married to a lone traveller, Felice (Lily Damita), and their seesawrelationship provides one of the main themes of a wideranging scenario,withBelmet and his mentors trumpeting of the glories of their fading way oflifewhile Felice seeks to inculcate within her swain a sense of domesticvirtue.The cinematography of Lee Garmes is very effective with its images of thetravails of the wagon train and his work is not compromised by the editingwhich is crisp and appropriate for a film as episodic as is this one.  Thework\'s most serious failing is a lack of a consistent point of view, as itis essentially a comedy, due largely to a highly effectual performancefromTorrence, here permitted to utilize his native Scottish burr to itsfullest,and is somewhat reduced in impact during scenes of action and romance as aresult of only cursory emphasis upon each.
