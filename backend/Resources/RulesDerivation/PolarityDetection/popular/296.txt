"Blood Money" shows just how risqu√© Hollywood could get before theHayes production code was imposed. There's never any actual nudity orgraphic violence shown, but there's a sleazy undercurrent runningthroughout the whole film that only the most oblivious wouldn't be ableto pick up on. The main character is a corrupt and unlikable criminalwho completely gets away free at the end, one of the femaleprotagonists is obviously a sado-masochist who wants a man to "be mymaster and give me a good thrashing", and there isn't a remotelyredeemable character in the whole affair. From a historical standpoint,this is one of the most fascinating pre-code dramas.In addition to being genuinely interesting and ahead of its time, its avery entertaining film. Its quickly paced and seems to be free of muchof the awkwardness associated with early sound cinema (maybe thematerial was just so shocking I was a bit distracted from theshortcomings). The acting is over-the-top for the most part, but neveractually bad. There's a lot of exciting situations and amusingly quirkycharacters as well. "Blood Money" isn't exactly a masterpiece, but itscertainly both interesting and entertaining. I've wanted to see itafter reading about it in "Ultimate Guide For the Film Fanatic" byDanny Peary, and I'm certainly not disappointed. Its very difficult totrack down, but entirely worth the search. (7/10)
