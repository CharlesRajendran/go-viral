Powerful anti war movie - the scenes with Frederic March in particularand Cary Grant are quite intense and grim, but there is some relief tocounter balance this aspect of the movie in the characters played byJack Oakie (comic) and Carole Lombard (sympathy).As another person has noted this was really directed by MitchellLeisen. who is credited as assistant director. This was his secondmovie (after Tonight is Ours, also with March in it) and he does a finejob. It shows what a versatile director he was, considering he made himhis name later with romance / comedy type movies like Midnight.It was done pre code but re-released in 1939 with some editing thatapparently lessens its impact (I have only seen the edited version).These are referred to in the book Mitchell Leisen Hollywood Director.The scenes with Carole Lombard are longer and imply a sexualrelationship afterwards. Cary Grant survives the war but is a brokenman. Would love to see the original (please let me know if anyone has it).If the edited parts are still available this movie would warrant arestoration to its original vision. A DVD release along these lineswould be most welcome.
