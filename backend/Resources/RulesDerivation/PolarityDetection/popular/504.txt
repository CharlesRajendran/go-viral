It constantly amazes me that people carp that this won best Picture, asthough no movie before or since ever won when maybe they shouldn\'thave. It was a big picture, it had a great story, it gave a lot of bangfor the buck and that has always been a factor in grabbing the Oscar.It does seem a bit dated to us now, used to high flying specialeffects, different acting styles, and quick cut editing, instead ofletting the scene play out as it so often does here, but it\'s such agreat story. The circus itself is a character and the way Demille usedthe audience to make them seem so individual is wonderful. And I\'m notjust referring to the Hope/Crosby cameo. Remember the fat guy with thekid scarfing down the ice cream laughing his head off while the kidlooked confused? You could tell he was reliving his childhood and hebecame EveryMan to us with only seconds of screen time. That\'s mastery.The integration of the real circus people with the actors was seamlessand if nothing else this movie captures a time when the circus wasreally a circus. Carp all you want, guys. But I think you may be toospoiled by ultra realism to appreciate the subtler gems in this veryrespectable film.
