Charles Laughton goes sort of over the top in this little movie. The plotisreminiscent of "Postman Always Rings Twice", i.e. sweet lil\' immigrantmeetsgirl & loses girl to employee, but without James M Cain\'s violence.Laughton\'s Tony really is a most happy fella, & Lombard is as usual,steamy.Totally by chance, I happened to do a double bill of this and the 1935Mutiny On The Bounty. I should have added Ruggles Of Red Gap, Hunchback,Hobson\'s Choice, and Witness For The Prosecution for a total Laughtonimmersion.This was filmed on location in an incredibly rural Napa Valley, and ifyou\'re familiar with Napa Valley, you may recognize what is now theCalistoga Inn/Napa Valley Brewing as Tony\'s local cantina/bar. I\'d like tosee a cleaned up version of this, as the print I saw was verrrydark.Good little movie.
