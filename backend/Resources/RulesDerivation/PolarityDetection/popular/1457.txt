Another older film which is, unfortunately ,unavailable in video or DVD.This is a refreshing holiday movie in that it shys away from the blatantsweetness of most holiday pictures.It deals well with a family in post-warBritain that has survived the ordeal with several scars.Sir Ralph Richardson is excellent as a clergyman and a father trying todealwith uprisings and emotion within his family, caught between the "old" andthe progressive. The english cast is as usual excellent - watch for ayouthful Denholm Eliot.Too bad the film isn\'t shown often, especially for a needed change of pacefrom the usual Christmas line-up that happens every year.
