Cute comedy about a novelist (Claudette Colbert) who meets a soldier (JohnWayne) and realizes she loves him.  There\'s more to it than that, butthat\'sthe bare bones of the plot.  The movie moves quickly, is VERY funny and whoknew John Wayne could do comedy so well?  Colbert beautiful and charming(asalways). There\'s also a few appearances from stars of that era.  Bright,breezy...well worth seeing.
