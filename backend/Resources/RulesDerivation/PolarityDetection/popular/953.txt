"Payment on Demand" begins when David tells Joyce that he wants a divorce.In flashbacks we see how the couple came from humble beginnings and workedtheir way into affluence.  David started from being a lawyer with noclientsand worked his way up to being vice president of his best client, a steelcompany.  Joyce  was always preoccupied with security, money and status;sheis a selfish, manipulative social climber and we can readily see why Davidwants out.  As always, Bette Davis plays the bitch with consummate skill.What follows shows the old-style divorce process at its worst andchroniclesJoyce\'s life as a single woman.  While this part is very well written, itisdated.  We learn that an older  single woman  has no life (other thanhavingto pay younger men to sleep with them) and you\'re always better off with aman.While the themes of this film may seem pretty conventional by today\'sstandards, they were anything but in 1951.  Divorce was a subject literallyruled off the screen by the very Catholic-oriented Hays Code.  Aside fromfrothy romantic comedies like "The Awful Truth," people just didn\'t getdivorced because they were fed up with their spouses.  Nor do films of thatHays era (from 1934 until 1968) ever delve into the actual process ofcontested divorce (such as the negotiations about property settlements).This film does all that.  While the ending may seem disappointing (and wasprobably a concession to the censors), the rest of the film is excellentandway ahead of its time.
