Certainly, in my opinion, the Greatest comedy short of alltime.Charlie, an escaped convict, saves life of rich woman and is taken in byherfamily(and jealous Eric Campbell - who tragically died in an automobileaccident a year after).How long will it be till the law catches up with him?There\'s an absolutely SUPERB sequence as him dodging the law using slidingdoors, it will leave you laughing loud.  This film alone demonstratesChaplin\'s unique and incredible talent.Many people get turned off by Chaplin\'s shorts as they are silent.  It\'s ashame as some of them represent his best work.
