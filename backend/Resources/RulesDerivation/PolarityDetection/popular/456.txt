This movie is so much fun to watch! Tells us the story of Don Camillo, aRoman Catholic priest in a small Italian parish. Life in the village ischange forever when Peppone, the communist mayor, is elected. The two areput one against the other. And what follows is a wacky list of situations!What I like most about this movie, it\'s the simple way it puts things. Youcan actually believe that this village exists and that what\'s being told inthe movie really happened.Fernandel is great as Don Camillo, the hot-headed priest. And Gino Cervishines in the role of Peppone. See this one, you won\'t regret it. Fun frombeginning to end!Out of 100, I gave it 87. That\'s good for ***Â½ out of ****.Seen at home, in Toronto, on September 1st, 2002.
