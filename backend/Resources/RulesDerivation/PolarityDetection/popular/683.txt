This is a sparkling and witty fantasy about a pampered society dame (KayFrancis) who has become aware of the hollowness of her life and a dapperjewel thief (William Powell) who steals her treasures and awakens her fromher golden tedium. I call it a "fantasy" because, sadly, we\'ve become tooaware of how real crime and criminals work. There\'s no effort to concealfaces, the robbery crew addresses each other by first name, Powell playssoothing music and engages in witty banter with those he\'s robbing, butnonetheless it\'s very entertaining to watch. Another odd aspect of thisunusual film is that Powell gives his victims marijuana cigarettes tosmoke,to make them passive and jovial. This is one of those pre-code films fromthat tiny window where sound had come in, the depression was on and theProduction Codes weren\'t re-writing movies like Jewel Robbery. See it whenyou can. Like the object of it\'s main character obsession, it is truly agem.
