William Powell is a smooth jewel thief who captivates Kay Francis in"Jewel Robbery," a 1932 film made before the dreaded code kicked in.Set in Vienna, Francis plays a baroness who, like her friends, hasmarried a dull man for money and takes lovers. While her husband isbuying her a 28-carat diamond and she\'s arguing with her boyfriend,William Powell and his team enter to rob the store. It\'s love at firstsight.This is a slight but very amusing film, interesting for the racy storyline, the outfits, and Kay Francis herself. A very unusual-lookingwoman, Francis\' heyday was in the \'30s, and everything about herscreamed \'30s, of course - her hair, her fashions, and the kind offilms she made. She\'s somewhat frozen in time there. Powell is hisusual dashing, delightful self, and the two work very well together.The scene at Powell\'s place is particularly interesting, as she demandsnot to be asked to do anything, but to be forced, at which point, hepicks her up and throws her onto his huge bed. "But there are so manypleasant in between steps," she objects.A delightful movie, not terribly long, but fascinating given the era infilm in which it was made.
