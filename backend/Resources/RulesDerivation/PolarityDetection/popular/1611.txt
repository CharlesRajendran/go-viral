Well-done film noir about a railroad engineer, Jeff Warren (GlennFord), who gets mixed up with a beautiful femme fatale (Gloria Grahame)who comes complete with husband who has murdered a man in a train carin an act of jealousy - and happens to be one of Warren's co-workers.Meeting her on the train just after the murder, kissing her withinmoments of meeting, it seemed like, our railroad man is soon embroiledin a love affair with this woman, who can't break away from her husbandas he is holding a piece of blackmail over her head involving themurder.This film is quite a good one, boosted up considerably by the greatperformance given by Gloria Grahame, who brings a sad vulnerability toher character and really makes this film. Broderick Crawford is alsovery good, as the angry, murderous husband and Glenn Ford comes acrossas the handsome, strong, quiet type which completely suits his part -well done acting all around for this. This film also featuresinteresting photography and lighting typical of this style of film - Iespecially like the way the train scenes are shot, with the camerastrapped to the front of the train, giving a first-person ride alongthe railroad tracks. A gripping film with a plot that kept meinterested from beginning to end.
