I enjoyed this film, its easily equal to the screwball comedies beingmade in the US at that time. In some ways even more daring since itdeals with subjects that would quickly be censored in the US. Suicide,extramarital sex & office romances, a single woman staying andtraveling with a single man (It Happened One Night), cross dressing,rowdy stag parties that walk a thin line just to mention a few. Plusthe scenes around pre-war London are fun. But the real reason forwatching this film is Laura LaPlante, what a terrific actress. Greatcomedic timing, a natural accent, pretty in a non-30's way (I keptthinking of Laura Dern), and obviously willing to do slapstick.LaPlante energized every scene she was in, and put sappy MargaretLockwood to shame. Its a mystery why she couldn't compete with thelikes of Carole Lombard or Myrna Loy - she was definitely their equal.I particularly liked the scene by the river when Mary is trying to gether nerve up to jump in, but her nerves and the river aren't quite upto the task. The stag party scene made me cringe, was that planned bythe director - or was that truly a more innocent time. While Mary maybe a dreamer - she's not stupid, she enjoys a challenge, and she hasfound it in the Fairbanks character. There was an off hand chemistrybetween La Plante and Fairbanks and its a shame that it wasn'tnurtured. I would like to see more of the British La Plante moviesscreened.
