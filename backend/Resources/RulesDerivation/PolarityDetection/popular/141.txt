Contrary to previous reviews of Ramrod, de Toth\'s film is much moreinteresting than a "simple cattle vs. sheep" plot-driven western. Justlookat Lake\'s Connie Dickinson. This is a typical femme fatale archetype takenstraight from film noir (realistically, the character  derives fromhard-boiled pulp literature which Luke Short fused with his westernstory).Sexually alluring Connie uses her potent sway over men to achieve hergreedyambitions of wealth and power, and is unafraid to send men to their deathsfor her cause. Connie\'s strength of character is atypical of the westerngenre at this stage, and her strength seems to come from the relativeweakness of the film\'s hero, played by Joel McCrea; who seems to lack thestrong sense of moral certainty that the typical westerner was foundedupon.Along with Raoul Walsh\'s Pursued (1947), and Robert Wise\'s Blood on theMoon(1948), Ramrod stands as one of the few hybrids between film noir and thewestern. Regardless of your standpoint on the status of film noir, all ofthese films contain typical elements from the pessimistic noirs of the40\'sand 50\'s, particularly formal and stylistic devices, as well as recurringpersonnel, especially directors, stars (ie. Robert Mitchum), andcinematographers. Crucially though, the western genre before this stagewasa particularly optimistic one; look at Stagecoach (John Ford, 1939), DodgeCity (Michael Curtiz, 1939), or even My Darling Clementine (Ford again,1946); the three films I mentioned beforehand, including Ramrod, all offerinstances of pessimistic worldviews, and morally ambiguous characters andsituations, even though they all end with the hero getting the girl andriding into a westward sunset.
