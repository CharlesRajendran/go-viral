Having recently completed a film article due for publication in FILMS OF THEGOLDEN AGE on Ida Lupino, it\'s a pleasure to report that this is one of herbest early performances. She plays a terrified young woman who seeks thehelp of Sherlock Holmes when she becomes concerned about her brother\'ssafety. He soon determines that she too is being stalked by killers. Herbrother is killed and the plot thickens with a sub-plot involving ProfessorMoriarty\'s plans to steal the Crown Jewels and the Star of Delhi. Holmeseventually solves the case and defeats the diabolical Moriarty with a planof his own. Reviewers judged this film even superior to the earlier \'Houndof the Baskervilles\'. Indeed, it\'s fully as atmospheric and suspenseful withhandsomely staged scenes in gas-lit Victorian London. George Zucco makes anideal villain and the main roles by Rathbone, Nigel Bruce and Ida Lupino arehandled with their customary skill. Definitely worth seeing and far superiorto the later Universal entries which updated all of the Holmes stories.
