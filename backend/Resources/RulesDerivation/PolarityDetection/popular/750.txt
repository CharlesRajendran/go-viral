Yes, this film can be accused of being cliched and peppered withpropaganda.It had it\'s share of critics even when it was released.  It had the talltask of being compared to " Mrs. Miniver" but in the end it stands on it\'sown as a classic gem.  To really enjoy and understand this movie (andtruly,all vintage movies)you must place yourself in their time and place.. thecontext of the times.I grew up hearing the stories of the hardships of the depression and WWII.My family was not as well off as the family in this film but the emotionswere the same.  If  "since you went away" seems at times to be a littlepreachy, consider it a peak into a long gone America that we sorely coulduse a lot of today.In the meantime, enjoy the wonderful acting, direction, lighting andbeautiful score- and of course, the greatest goodby scene of all time! Thetrain station farewell is a masterpiece by itself...get yourkleenex!
