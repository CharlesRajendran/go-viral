Most big-screen spin-offs of successful television sitcoms are hugelydisappointing, and in some cases unbearable, so I approached this one withlow expectations. In all fairness, it shouldn\'t really work. After all,Richard Beckinsale\'s Alan - the brilliantly naive medical student of the TVseries - is a very sad loss (Beckinsale died young, and is still much missedover twenty years later), and he\'s been replaced with the charisma-freeChristopher Strauli, as a too-old art student named John. Secondly, thescript is cobbled together from several episodes (admittedly classicepisodes) of the series, so even casual fans will get a hint of deja-vu. Butin spite of these obvious flaws, RISING DAMP is consistently amusing andentertaining. Leonard Rossiter\'s excellent performance as the leering,sneering, tight-fisted landlord from hell is worth the admission pricealone, and as an added bonus we get to see the old devil as Noel Coward andJohn Travolta in a couple of jaw-dropping fantasy sequences. Eric Chappell\'sscreenplay would be glaringly politically incorrect these days (when Philip- supposedly an African prince - asks if he can watch the England vs theWest Indies cricket match on Rigsby\'s television, Rigsby refuses, becauseit\'s a colour set and he doesn\'t want to waste the licence fee watchingsomething that "looks the same in black and white"!) but it\'s all funnystuff and delivered with gusto by a great cast. In fact, Chappell pulls outall the stops to make us laugh and wince in equal measures - several oldjokes (a bull mistaken for a cow, Rigsby\'s Eric Morecambe-style boxingshorts, Philip and John crashing through the ceiling into another tenant\'sbedroom, people hiding under beds and in wardrobes) are revived, Rossiterrattles through his extraordinary dialogue with stunning ease (and everyword, however quickly delivered, is clear and distinct) and Frances De LaTour is even more hysterically over-the-top than usual as theultra-frustrated spinster Miss Jones. Some previous reviewers have notedthat we shouldn\'t have been told that Philip\'s pose was acarefully-contrived scam, but let\'s face it, that much was obvious from thestart; and others have noted that Rigsby and his object of desire are"paired off", but they can\'t have been watching the ending very closelybecause...well, I\'m not going to spoil things for you, but let\'s just sayVienna gets in the way again!Okay, so this isn\'t the TV series, but it\'s no screaming disaster either,and fans of the shows will find much to amuse them. RIP Rossiter andBeckinsale.
