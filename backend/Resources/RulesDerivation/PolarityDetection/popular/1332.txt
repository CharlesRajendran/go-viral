We would always gauge films with the old test of... if you were goingto be shot off in a capsule into space and could only take 10 movies...this one would be the first I would chose. Dialog is excellent andfollows the story from the book. Casting is spot on with the obviousout of the park home run for the choice of Wallace Beery as Long JohnSilver. The mark of his skill and acting in this film, is that eventhough he describes in some detail the murders he committed of hisshipmates (there were too many to share the treasure) and is seen inthe film.. as best as it was shown in the '30's... killing yet again...by the end of the film you have forgotten his evil. How can thishappen? Simply because he is that wonderful in the part. Nigel Bruce(Dr. Watson) as the bumbling Squire, and Harold Stone (JudgeHardy)round out the cast in glowing Technicolor. Jackie Cooper has beenknocked for giving a "stiff" performance, but I thought he was great.Give the kid a break. Many great lines, memorable moments and favoritescenes that will stay with you long after the movie ends. This is onethat I can happily watch once a week forever.For me this will always be the classic and definitive version,everything else is just chasing this one and none have come close.
