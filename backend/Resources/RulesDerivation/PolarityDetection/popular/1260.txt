I saw this movie a long time ago as a teenager during a Edward G.Robinson retrospective. It was the one that stuck in my mind, and Inever forgot it. Now I have it on videotape and watch it regularly, itstands multiple viewing very well.The Whole Town\'s Talking is one of those perfect little movies.Everything falls into place  the acting, the pace, the timing of thejokes, the dialog. Even the set design is fabulous, it was basicallythe big, bright office space in which the good guy Robinson playsslaves" that was unforgettable to me. The movie boasts an assortmentof caricature like characters like no other movie I know, besideRobinson I would like to mention Jean Arthur, of course, and the twofunny little guys, Donald Meek and, even more memorable, EtienneGirardot as the pedantic office overseer who urges Robinson to get onwith the Macintyre account.In its social comment The Whole Town\'s Talking reminds me of the workof Preston Sturgess. Mentionable are the media hype about a famousgangster which is really over the top (it\'s up there with His GirlFriday in this aspect) and the incompetence of the police force whichis unable to deal with the gangster and even less with the media and ispresented as a helpless and clueless organization. So the movie stillhas some actuality.Movie buffs who look at John Ford as an auteur" may be disappointed.The Whole Town\'s Talking is very much a product of the studio system.But it amply shows what great things that system was able to accomplishat times!
