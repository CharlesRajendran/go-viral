Enjoyable 30's potboiler if you are a Kay Francis fan (as I am) Justsaw this on TCM after years of wanting to see it. It starts out as aDietrich/Sternberg foreign locale kind of pic, but switches gearsmidway and becomes a standard soap opera tale. Like many Warners 30'sfilms its barely over an hr and parts of the story seem left on thecutting room floor or are not fleshed out properly. For example, itsnever explained why Francis is hiding out with Cortez on his boat inthe beginning. Francis is not particularly believable as a Russian onthe lam in the Orient, but she is effective playing the part, as longas you don't dwell on her background for too long. The first part ofthe film is very entertaining and risqu√©, its a shame it switches gearsonce Kay takes off for Mandalay. Kay wears some fab gowns and is alwayswatcheable. She gets to sing too(probably dubbed), but 3 times for thesame song is a little much. This role was originally intended for RuthChatterton, whom I cant picture playing it. Its campy fun and Kay isKay. Watching her can be addicting........
