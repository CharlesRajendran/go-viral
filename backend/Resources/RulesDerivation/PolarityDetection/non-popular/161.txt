Play Girl (1932) *** (out of 4)Irresistible pre-code about a working class girl (Loretta Young) whobelieves in working for something in life and not just marrying intoit. She eventually falls for a compulsive gambler (Winnie Lightener)and after their married the ugly nature of gambling comes into play.This is a wickedly funny and in the end depressing little tale thatworks wonders in its short sixty-minute running time. Young andLightener make for a terrific couple and the racy sexual dialogue makesfor some great laughs. Young is beautiful and charming as ever anddelivers a knockout performance. This was the first film I've seenLightener in but he was wonderful as well. Edward Van Sloan has a smallpart as well.
