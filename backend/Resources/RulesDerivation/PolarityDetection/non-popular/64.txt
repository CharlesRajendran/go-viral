The last and craziest of the six Hubie & Bertie cartoons, about twodecidedly non-country mice.  In this one, the pair have been living in acheese factory and, having eaten enough cheese for the next two thousandyears, decide to end it all, by leaping into the mouth of Claude Cat,theirdupe in the Oscar-winning MOUSE WRECKERS.  The entire cycles goes on andon,with many a funny sight gag. Highly recommended.
