Damon Runyon was another one of those writers whose work nevertransferred very successfully to the screen. Even the great ErnestHemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald had troublesome films made from theirnovels. Runyon failed before with THE BIG STREET (Lucille Ball as ahard-boiled dame using Henry Fonda as a doormat) but had better luckwhen GUYS AND DOLLS transformed one of his works into a musical.Here it fails once again to provide BOB HOPE and LUCILLE BALL withanything more than routine roles in this racetrack comedy about anunlikely man to chaperone a kid (MARY JANE SAUNDERS in the roleoriginated by Shirley Temple in "Little Miss Marker"). Saunders iscute, but that's about it. She's no Temple and never went on to childstar stardom as Temple did.Sidney Lanfield directed a lot of lightweight films for Paramount, notall of them successful, and this has to be counted among his leastlikable comedies--unless, of course, you happen to be a fan of thestars and can watch them in anything.Hope has some amusing one-liners as the man who takes a marker on a kidwho becomes a big part of his life and Lucille Ball has a few quips ofher own. Adolphe Menjou played the unsuitable man in the Temple film,with better and more believable results. Hope and Ball are simplykilling time here and it shows.The story, which depends so much on the charisma and appeal of a childstar, simply hasn't got the strength to support Hope and Ball. Thisone's a real loser without the charm of the original.
