This show has one of the greatest theme tunes ever!It\'s a pretty good show otherwise, and is available in the UK on DVD(budget).It follows the adventures of cocky young pup Dogtanian in hisquestto become one of the Royal Musketeers. Created as a joint collaborationbetween France and Japan, it retains many of the qualities that make animeso popular.I think it should be made into a live action film starring Jack NicholsonasDogtanian. That\'d be worth seeing...
