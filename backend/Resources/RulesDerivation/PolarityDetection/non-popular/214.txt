Who narrates? A snippet of this film is played in "Walk The Line", andthe snippet has turned me into a whirling dervish. The narrator voice ICANNOT get out of my head. I have been on the main message boardalready. Any help would be appreciated. The narrator sounds like theburning bush voice in The Ten Commandmants. I know it is supposed to beHeston as the God voice in the Ten Commandmants, but ......I am notsure. The two voices, narrator Inside Folsom Prison, burning bush TenCommandmants sound the same to me and I Do not think it was CharltonHeston. I don't know how much can be done with sound manipulation inthe 50's. Is anyone else hearing what I am hearing or am I just crazy?Please see main message board, Trivia for thread of answers. Thanks forany help.
