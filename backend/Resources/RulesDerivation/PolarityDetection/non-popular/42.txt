The sort of line-drawing animation that is used in this Silly Symphonyabout cannibals in Africa is interesting.... a sort of animated linedrawing, eked out a bit -- arms and legs thin lines, hands and feetbig. But the modern viewer will be offended. The extreme stereotype ofBlacks will offend the modern viewer, just as, doubtless, some of themodern images we hold to be normative will offend people three quartersof a century hence .... or indeed, now. All comedy, after all, istransgressive behavior at some level, but the line between amusinglytransgressive and offensively so depends on viewpoint. Consider the Jewof Malta, Shylock and Fagin or the comedy act of Stepin Fetchitt. Oneof his stage acts was to sit in a chair and read a paper while one ofhis comedy recordings was playing.But this one is offensive to the modern viewer and should be viewedpurely as a product of its time. And should be watched and commented onif only to keep the reality that 'Uncle Walt' was an artificialconstruct, just as much as his cartoons.
