I can only assume that before he started out in the role he asked theRKO excutives to run "Room Service" so that he could perfect his ChicoMarx impression for this film.He wears a black curly wig not unsimilarto Marx,and apart from the fact that he does not play the piano he doeseverything else.So little wonder that this film had a very torturedproduction costing over $850000 and posting a loss of over $200000.Itis difficult to understand why Laughton did these sort of films.He madesome great films in the 1930s however he went to Hollywood more or lessfor good in 1939 and almost ruined his career in the 1940s withs someawful films.Lombard is fine but unbelievable as the waitress and Faydreadful as the priest.
