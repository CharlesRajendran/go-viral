An early B comedy by Phil Karlson this was a nice surprise with a stonecold open on an odious blackmailer making his rounds. Ooops! It's acrusading reporter shaking down his list of suckers. The opening scenehas him slapping a "sucker", who kinda likes it, and then relieving herof the stiletto she was about to slide into his back. So there's noshortage of suspects.Kane Richmond is solid as Lamont/Shadow with a Jack Carson-likepresence, albeit on a B level. The rest of the cast has a few familiarfaces. Condolences to others who also peg the killer. It's a formulaicclich√© that has been done to death but I actually liked that I couldfinger the culprit at first siting. Lots of inappropriate humor, S&M is a strong undercurrent with acomical cross dressing sequence thrown in, this movie begins and endswith slaps and spankings. If you think this stuff is "corny" becauseit's period 40s... too bad for you.
