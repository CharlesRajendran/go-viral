This cartoon has Sylvester Cat, Tweety Bird, and a bulldog all snuck ina deluxe apartment building where no pets are aloud. They have to avoidthe manager while chasing each other around. I\'m not the biggest Tweetybird fan, I thought at one point he may have been tolerable, but I gotover that fast. I\'m sorry, I did give him so many chances to change mymind, but Nada. The biggest laughs come from Sylvester and the bulldog(ok and Tweety in ONE instance when they dress up like one old woman)This animated short can be seen on Disc 3 of the Looney Tunes GoldenCollection Volume 2.My Grade: C+
