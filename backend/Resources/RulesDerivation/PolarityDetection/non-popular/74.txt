"Raba lyubvi" - called "Slave of Love" in English - portrays silentscreen star Olga Voznesenskaya (Yelena Solovey) getting caught up inthe 1917 revolution. She\'s trying to reconnect with a former lover, butthe surrounding events complicate everything. What the movie\'s titleshows is that Olga is not only a slave of love, but also of worldevents, of her career, and of her fans (I guess that even undercommunism - or whatever it was - people turn into celebrityfetishists!). As often happens in Soviet-era movies, there\'s a lot ofexaggerated facial expressions. Director Nikita Mikhalkov appears as awaiter.
