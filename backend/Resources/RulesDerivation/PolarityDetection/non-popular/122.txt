When you think of musicals, you would never think of Pat O'Brien. Henever demonstrated any musical aptitude in films and here he lookstotally out of place as a guy trying to promote a high-brow singer(James Melton). What's more out of place, other than Melton's operaticwarbling, are the terrible amateur-hour acts that are interspersedthroughout the film. The worst is probably the God-awful gospel groupthat did more to encourage atheism than any other act in film history!!In addition to the non-singer O'Brien is non-singer Frank McHugh--whois more pushy and loud than normal (not that he ever played subtle).It's easy to hate him in this film--which is a shame, as he's generallya likable sort of sidekick.The film has a thin story, some crazy production numbers (choreographedby Busby Berkeley), a lot of annoying singing and, well, that's reallyabout all. I love Pat O'Brien but somehow he got lost amidst thecacophony. As you might guess, I am not a huge fan of musicals--but ifI do see one, I'd prefer it be a lot better than this one (such as"42nd Street" or any of the Astaire-Rogers films). Pretty dull and hardon the ears.
