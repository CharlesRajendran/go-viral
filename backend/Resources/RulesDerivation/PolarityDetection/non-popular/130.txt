This is the third Olsen and Johnson film I have seen recently and it'squite watchable...but nothing more. If you have seen HELLZAPOPPIN(probably their best film), this film and the rest of their films areapparently nothing like it!! HELLZAPOPPIN is crazy and pushes theboundaries of film and it's a shame that they didn't make more like it.COUNTRY GENTLEMEN (and the rest of their films) are much morestructured and conventional. In many ways, their films are a lot likelower budget Abbott and Costello movies--though Olsen and Johnson mademost of their films before Abbott and Costello came to Hollywood. Somaybe that means Abbott and Costello films are like Olsen and Johnsonfilms.The film begins with the team running from the law, as they'dapparently sold interests in a gold mine that didn't pay off.Unfortunately, in the next locale, their luck isn't any better and theybuy an oil well...that also appears to be worthless. The problem isthat the nice townspeople have just invested and when they discover thetruth Olsen and Johnson will be lucky if the people in this small towndon't string them up to the nearest tree! Unfortunately, the film has a few strikes against it. First, like somany of their films, many of the jokes fall rather flat. Second, theending is incredibly lame, as it's all way too predictable andconvenient. However, in between the film is at least pleasant andbreezy--especially since the DVD I found was the shortened 53 minuteversion. Too short? Maybe, but without the original longer version,it's hard to tell. Also, unlike the last Olsen and Johnson film I saw,ALL OVER TOWN, at least Ole Olsen doesn't use his annoying laughingshtick nearly as much. That laugh could curdle milk!!
