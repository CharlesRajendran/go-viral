The Americano (1955) ** 1/2 (out of 4) William Castle's Western is pretty familiar on many grounds but it'salso a lot different on others, which makes it worth checking out.American Sam Dent (Glenn Ford) heads to Brazil to sell his cattle sothat he and his brother can live better but once there he gets in themiddle of a land owner (Frank Lovejoy) and a "bandit" (Cesar Romero)who are battling each other. THE AMERICANO, story wise, really doesn'toffer us anything we haven't seen countless times before so if you'relooking for something original then you're certainly not going to findit here. Based on story alone this film would be worth skipping butwhat makes it so entertaining and worth watching are the locations. TheBrazilian jungle really makes for an interesting setting and I mustadmit that it was a lot of fun seeing some routine Western scenes"updated" for the location. How many times have we seen a scene wherethe cowboy must take the cattle across some water? Well, in the scenehere the problem is that there are crocodiles and piranhas in thewater. How many times have we seen the cowboy beat or threaten a badguy into telling the truth about something? Well, in this film thosesame piranhas are used to get him to talk. I really enjoyed seeingthese familiar scenes updated to the setting and throw in theTechnicolor and this really makes the film worth seeing. It alsofeatures some good performances with Ford leading the way playing agood guy like only he can. Lovejoy was extremely entertaining andsteals every scene he's in and Romero is also very good in his role.Castle's direction isn't anything ground-breaking but he does a goodjob piecing everything together and keeping the film flowing at a nicepace.
