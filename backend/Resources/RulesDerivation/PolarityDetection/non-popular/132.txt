"Moonlight Sword & Jade Lion" tells us about a young fighting lady,played by Angela Mao, who is on the search for an old master. Nobodyhas seen him for months, it appears, so she keeps asking people "haveyou seen him?" and sometimes she fights them if she doesn't like thereply. Now, the movie has a couple of memorable moments, such as thehilarious fight against roughly 20 enemies at once who are holdingflowers (sic!) which can shoot flames or darts. That doesn't help todisguise the fact the story isn't exactly Sherlock Holmes. The heroinespends a month wandering around looking for clues, doesn't findanything important, and most characters just seem to be introduced toconfuse her and the audience a bit. And if they do intend to tell heranything, they suddenly have a knife in their back. It was a relief tosee in the other reviews that nobody else understood what the Jade Lionwas for, either. So in the end, "Moonlight Sword & Jade Lion" is worthwatching only for fans of Angela Mao who bravely carries on despite thelack of story progress.
