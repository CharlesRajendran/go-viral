Peter Hayward (Richard Greene) leads the villagers in the town ofChaunduyt (pronounced "Condwit") against a landowner, Mr Pike (AlfredDrayton), who refuses to allow animals onto his land and wants toplough up the cricket pitch. Peter is helped by a ghost (Richard Bird)who has been released from the walls of a stately home after it hasbeen hit by a German bomb. Hey, it might be a British bomb, after all,we now know that in every war it seems traditional to kill your owntroops in some way. The film climaxes with a court scene and a surpriserevelation.I was hoping for a good ghost story but it is far from that.Unfortunately, this is another example of British silliness. The ghostas played by Richard Bird is hardly in the film and when he doesappear, he is portrayed as a friendly buffoon. Another buffoon who Isuspect was meant to court sympathy was the "Butler" as portrayed byEdward Rigby. We have tedious sections at the beginning of the filmwhere every time he moves around the stately home, he is accompanied bycomedy music. I found him irritating. There are some funny touches, eg,the fact that everyone in the village has the same name due toinbreeding throughout the years (a hot topic especially with the royalfamily) and this film gives us the original dilemma over thepronunciation of the surname "Bucket"...... or is that "Bouquet"? If you like silly British nonsense, then you will enjoy this film. It'snot a catastrophe but it is a disappointment.
