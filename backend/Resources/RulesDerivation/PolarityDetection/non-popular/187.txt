I never quite got into Hey Dad - it was so hit and miss. But worse wasthe spin off TV show set in a share house. When Mr Kelly turned up tocheck if it could be turned into a colloseum, that was about it'slowest point! And then it turned out to be heritage listed for BanjoPatterson! Jaysus.. but anyway, Hey Dad - we all know Nudge was cool.But Betty was one of the worst characters on Australian television.Simone was borrowed from Paradise Beach. Stan from Walgatt wasunderused gold! The stuttering guy should never have been allowed ontelevision. And the little fat kid probably grew up to be heath ledger.I have heard there's a Hey Dad MOVIE being made? Can anyone confirmthis for me??? PLEASE Say NUDGE has taken over the Kelly Business!!
