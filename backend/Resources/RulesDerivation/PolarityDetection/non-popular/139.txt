The Adventures of a Rookie (1943) * 1/2 (out of 4)RKO's attempted cash-in on Abbott and Costello's BUCK PRIVATES was thefirst film to feature the comic team of Wally Brown and Alan Carney. Inthe film they meet at an Army boot camp and soon they get mixed up inall sorts of trouble. Along for the ride is another soldier (RichardMartin) who keeps getting caught up in their hijacks. THE ADVENTURES OFA ROOKIE will probably drive many viewers to a depressed state and Ithink a lot of it is going to depend on how well you handle Brown andCarney. The duo made seven films together and they weren't successfulwhen originally released and it seems they haven't gained too many fansin the decades that followed. I've actually enjoyed a couple of theirhorror spoofs (ZOMBIES ON Broadway, GENIUS AT WORK) but it's hard tofind anything good to say about this film. At just 64-minutes the filmseems to drag on for hours and I really did get the feeling a coupletimes that it was never going to end. The biggest problem is thatthere's no screenplay to think of. It's as if RKO was just wanting anycomic team in any Army movie so that they could jump on the success ofBUCK PRIVATES. The military jokes are all lame and most of thesituations simply aren't funny. There's a running gag of a joke abouttwo cars going to Chicago that is old on the first telling and yet itjust keeps coming up. Brown and Carney are clearly still not overlyused to working with one another as their timing is off and there'sjust not a good mix going on. THE ADVENTURES OF A ROOKIE is one of theworst examples of a military comedy out there.
