In her next to last film Carole Landis goes across the pond with JosephCalleia to star in this British production The Silk Noose. Landis playsa Lois Lane type reporter who is doing an expose of the post warEnglish black market. The United Kingdom may have won the war, but thecountry was still without a lot of basic goods and rationing was stillstrict by the new Labour government.Try as I might I could not wrap myself around the concept of an Italianrunning London's black market, especially with regard to the recent warwith Italy. Still Calleia as always is one smooth operator whounfortunately has a temper with regard to bad publicity. Which is whatLandis plans to give him.Her ally is London cop Derek Farr who was a former commando in the latewar. In a rather extralegal maneuver he gets the participation of someof London's boxing clubs as his raiding party. That's something thatsure wouldn't fly on this side of the pond. Nigel Patrick is on hand as Calleia's right hand man and StanleyHolloway is a somewhat compromised police inspector. The treatment hereis most uneven and what should be atmospheric is somewhat dull.
