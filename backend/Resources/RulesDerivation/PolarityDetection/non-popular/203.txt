I initially began watching this film with the preconceivednotion that Louise Brooks had more of a major role. Inwhichshe had just a minor one. And so I was disappointed becauseof it. After having owned this video I can say that I haveonly seen it once, and that I remain neutral on the movieitself aside from the Louise Brooks issue. I have seenbetterold films though it did have it\'s more comical points thatI did enjoy.
