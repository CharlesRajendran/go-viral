Well, Bugsy and Mugsy is one of my personal favourite cartoonsfeaturing Mugsy and Rocky. Plus it has Bugs, who works brilliantly withthe right material. Bugsy and Mugsy is a classic for many reasons, witha somewhat simple story yes but it is very clever and funny.The animation is good, Bugsy and Mugsy has lovely backgrounds andcolours, and the music has a lot of energy. The dialogue is typicalLooney Tunes wit, but three things make it enjoyable. One is the sightgags, especially the end sequence with the magnet, words cannotdescribe how funny and clever that was. The second is Bugs, he has somegreat material and is just great fun as he manipulates Rocky intobelieving that Mugsy is untrustworthy. Then there is Mugsy and Rockythemselves, their interaction towards each other makes the cartoon sofunny, Mugsy dim-witted and oblivious to Bugs's actions and Rocky as heabuses Mugsy for doing something he didn't do, if that makes sense thatis. And I mustn't forget Mel Blanc, as always he is brilliant. Overall,this one is a classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox
