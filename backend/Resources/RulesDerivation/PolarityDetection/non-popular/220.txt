The plot is so tiny it almost falls off the screen.  Of course it\'s justanexcuse for Hayward to look gorgeous and for the performance of a number ofwartime hits.  But what is remarkable here are the black performers,including Count Basie and Dorothy Dandridge and a pair of amazing maledancers.  The central Sandman of Harlem number is outstanding.The rest is pretty dull with John Carroll trying to be Clark Gable - butEveArden provides a few laughs and she works very well withHayward.
