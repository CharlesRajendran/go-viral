Apart from the MGM staginess, this is kind of a fun little short,especially at the end when Froggy does his wire-assisted dance. There'sone part where he "runs" (or tries to) across the back curtain thatactually got a chuckle out of me.But, man, these kids can't act. Buckwheat barely gets by. Mickeydoesn't say much, and when he does, he says it adequately if shrilly.Janet's really horrible. She's given a "comic" line of "You're notgoing to (STAGE GASP) shoot yourself, are you?" that comes out likeshe's reading a cue card. Valerie "Marilyn" Lee, Froggy's loveinterest, is actually the best actress of the lot, and Maltin rightlysays her thespian skills are less than inspiring.If you must watch, you can get some humor out of Froggy's dancingsequence, so it's not a waste of time for Our Gang aficionados.
