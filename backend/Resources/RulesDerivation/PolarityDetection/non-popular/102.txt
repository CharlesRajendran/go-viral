Meredith moves to the Langrock estate to take care of Langrock himself,an ailing man whose legs no longer work. Langrock has a son who isdisturbed in some way, as well as his orphaned teenage grandson Gabrielwho returns from a desert commune (or something) to live with thefamily. Langrock's butler has been working his way through the winecellar for years, and the cook is proud of her granola...mmm.Gabriel is a strange young man who likes lurking in shadows, saying orreacting in peculiar ways and generally making people uneasy. Meredithis fascinated by him, but also fears he's behind the brutal death ofthe guard dog and the other deaths that follow.A fair amount of the movie also has voice-over by Meredith.The Embassy Home Entertainment VHS is not the best print; nighttimescenes or those in the cellar are dark and lack definition. The endcredits are fairly unreadable.
