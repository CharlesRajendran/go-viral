It's very hard, even for a German count, to be aristocratic throughoutthe entire day; that is to say, maintain without a blink a rigid poseas well as a haughty glance and accordingly, watch transcendentTeutonic silent pictures.Having this in mind together with the fact that laughing is a capitalsin for a genuine German count, one must allow for the fact thataristocratic flesh is weak and from time to time is prone to the sin ofprivately watching some of those superficial American comedies such as"Hands Up!" directed by Herr Clarence G. Badger in the silent year of1926.The film is set during the American civil war. Herr President Lincolnhas problems for financing the war but pretty soon he will haveexcellent news regarding this: a gold mine in Nevada has beendiscovered so the longhaired North will have financial support in orderto defeat the conservative South. Of course, Herr President Lincolnputs his best man in charge of such an important mission.But meanwhile a Southern soldier ( Herr Raymond Griffith ) is sent tothe West as a spy in order to retrieve the gold for the South ( thistime the American East was forgotten for this pictureÂ… ). It's not aneasy mission for the Southern spy; he must face many difficulties, themost terrible being that two Northern sisters will fall in love withhim."Hands Up!" was stars the not well-known American comedian, HerrRaymond Griffith, who was almost forgotten since the old silent daysalthough recently his few surviving films are screened again for thejoy of silent rarities admirers.This Herr Graf can define Herr Griffith's style as an imitation ofearlier famous silent comedians (especially Max Linder to whom he bearsa physical resemblance as well). gobbling up all these in order tocreate a not very original character, although effective in comicterms.In "Hands Up!" there are certainly many hilarious moments wherein HerrGriffith's character shines particularly, focusing every gag and thepicture itself around his persona, a character that it seemsextrapolated, inserted in a wrong context ( a top hat modernisticgentleman in the American civil war ) adding in this way a surreal,weird atmosphere to this silent comedy."Hands Up!" works pretty well for Herr Griffith even though his anticsare somewhat predictable and not very original.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave becausethis German Count must look for gold in his mines of the Ruhr.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzienhttp://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com
