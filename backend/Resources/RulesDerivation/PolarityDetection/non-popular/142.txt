This movie was recently on "Turner Movie Classics." Seeing the cableguide write-up and the fact that Lionel Barrymore was the headliner hadme looking forward to this film, but I was really disappointed.I have to admit, of a listed 83-minute film, I finally snapped it offwith about 45 minutes to go. I'm all for setting the scene, developingcharacters, etc., but enough was enough. There were a couple ofchuckles in the part I saw leading up to the death of the characterPeter Grimm and I knew it would probably get funnier with theappearance of his ghost, but I just gave up. I got to roughly 5 minutesafter his death and that was it.The entire first half was tedious character/storyline development whichwas WAY too much! They could've accomplished everything they wanted todo in about 15 minutes and then spent the roughly 70 remaining minuteson the humor, fantasy, and fun.Perhaps someday I'll sit down and watch the rest of this movie, but,for what it's worth, I didn't care too much for what I saw.
