Jolly good show eld chap - bit of a must see if you like that eld song...Idon\'t know what the makers of this film were thinking,  but it wasobviouslysomething along the lines of "Dash it all! We appear to got ourselves intoaspot of bother here! Too many of the chaps and gels have accents whicharen\'t quite up to par! Well, not to fear - technology to the rescue! I\'lljust call up the chaps at the club and get them to lend theirdistinguishedQueens English voices to making this film a ripping english yarn about aGerman singer and a Swiss Jewish music artist..."Well, the dubbing of an obviously English film with \'upper crust\' Englishaccents had me rolling in the aisles, snorting with laughter at somepointsthroughout the film - it all rather distracted from what was really a verygood film. Although the editing was a bit choppy in places (1970\'s relictdirecting?), the film faily trundles along providing a genteel look at thedistractions and hardships WWII had on life in Europe. True, towards theend, one can sympathise with Giancarlo Giannini\'s \'torture\' scene wheretheGermans lock him up in a room to listen to a couple of lines from thesong,\'Lili Marleen\' over and over again... How much was Giannini acting and howmuch was genuine suffering??? But, if you can overlook the dreadfuldubbing,this is a good film!
