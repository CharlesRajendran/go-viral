Anna Neagle was better known for this film than any of the others shehas made. A story of a French mother with three young children livingin Britain, who is recruited by the spy service to return to Nazioccupied France as an undercover spy. Neagle plays Odette. Her handler(Peter Churchill) in France is played by Trevor Howard and there isalso a young Peter Ustinov as a message transmitter.The initial part of the film is bland with Odette delivering andretrieving messages which has little or no tension. However once MariusGoring enters as a German officer who seems to despise the Nazis,things take an interesting turn. Odette and Churchill are captured andOdette is tortured by the Nazis which is the harrowing part of thefilm.Neagle, Goring, Ustinov and Howard are all excellent but the film islet down with the less than rip roaring spy adventures at the beginningand the latter part would now deemed to be too tame, even though gooduse of make up is made for the months of abuse at the prison camp.Even though Odette is starved of food you cannot help noticing thatactress still looks slightly plump. Its details like this that lets thefilm down.
