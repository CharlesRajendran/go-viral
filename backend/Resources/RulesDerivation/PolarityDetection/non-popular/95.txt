Sylvester cat is adamant about catching and eating Tweety Bird, butthere\'s a catch Tweety has been bought by Granny who has countlessvicious bulldogs in her fenced yard. The usual hijinx ensue. This isgood only because of Sylevester as I detest that everything about thatdamned speech impediment singing Tweety bird and the Granny. Thisanimated short can be seen on Disc 3 of the Looney Tunes GoldenCollection Volume 2 and also features an optional commentary by GregFord that is infinitely better than the actual cartoon that it commentson. I\'m really getting tired of having to review Tweety cartoons.My Grade: C
