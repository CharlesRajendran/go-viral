"Fun with Dick and Jane" is a solid, well-made family movie, althoughit goes without saying that it\'s not perfect.Dick (George Segal) is a successful upper-class businessman whosuddenly loses his job when his boss (Ed McMahon) fires him. His wife,Jane (Jane Fonda), soon finds her world turned upside-down as she ishard-pressed to afford the most simple commodities.In a last-ditch effort, the couple turn to harmless crime such asrobbing banks (never killing people - it is a PG movie after all andthey aren\'t Bonnie and Clyde, as the tagline says), until they decideto even rip off Dick\'s ex-boss at one of his Christmas parties.The movie is being remade this year with Jim Carrey (originally toco-star Cameron Diaz, who pulled out) and I don\'t think it\'s necessary.The original works as an amiable, entertaining family comedy and aremake set today would only seem redundant.The cast is strong - McMahon is a scene-stealer and Fonda and Segalhave good chemistry.It\'s a lite version of "Bonnie and Clyde" with a predictablyfairy-tale-happy ending and likable characters. It\'s not ugly ormean-spirited, it\'s just a nice family film - and what more would youexpect from a movie called "Fun with Dick and Jane"? (Well, other thanporn, obviously.)
