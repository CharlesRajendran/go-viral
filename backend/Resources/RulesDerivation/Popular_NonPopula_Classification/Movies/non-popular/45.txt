Hans (Hans Hirschm√ºller) is a street fruit peddler and born-loser. Hischoice of career upsets his bourgeois family, causing him to turn todrinking and violence. After recovering from a debilitating heartattack, his business finally begins to take off. However the more hebecomes a credit to his family, the more depressed he becomes."The Merchant of Four Seasons" was a turning point in Fassbinder'scareer, marking his entry into the international film arena. It isconsidered by film critics to be one of Fassbinder's best films. Forme, it was alright but not what I would consider among his best. Numberone would have to be "Ali", and it is hard to dismiss "World on aWire".Granted, I have not perused the Criterion DVD, and maybe I just do notunderstand the complete context of this film. Another time?
