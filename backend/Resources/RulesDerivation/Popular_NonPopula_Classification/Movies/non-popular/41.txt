Take the movie in stride. The one thing about watching a film involvingreligious ideas, is that you shouldn't take it seriously. Then again,you should never take a fictional story without a message seriously.It's a horror film, and that's all. It's even a pretty good one, if youjust sit down and watch. Don't obsess about little details, like thehistory of the catholic church, or how blasphemous character actionsmight be. Truth is, it's just a story. Once a person can understand andappreciate that, they might find it pretty scary. There are certainlysome creepy aspects to it...and slightly depressing ones. Frankly, tobe offended by THIS movie out of all of the modern tripe one could befar more so offended by...is ridiculous.
