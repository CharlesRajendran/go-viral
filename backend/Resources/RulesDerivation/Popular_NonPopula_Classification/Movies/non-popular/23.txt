Thank goodness I didn\'t pay to see this one. My eyes were literally glazingover about twenty minutes into this waste of film. Heath Ledger isunconvincing as a twenty-something hunk priest who is a member of someoutcast order of the Catholic Church (yeah right!). His previouslyexcommunicated mentor dies mysteriously and so he has to track down the sineater, a guy who absorbs the sins of excommunicated people in a freakyritual. Or something like that, truthfully I was too bored to care. Thereare a couple of demon children wandering around, but what their purpose isis never explained. Nothing in this movie is ever explained. The love storyis boring and not the slightest bit moving, the sidekick priest is boring,the sin eater and the evil priest are boring. The special effects are stupidand boring. The whole movie is just boring to the point of tears. Also, thedialog is so low and the actors mumble so much that you can barely hear whatthe heck they\'re saying. Do not ever see this movie. Don\'t rent it andplease don\'t buy it unless you are an insomniac who would like to get tosleep without pills or alcohol. That\'s the only way this would be worth apurchase.
