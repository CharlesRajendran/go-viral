How can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me.The idea? It has none. "A guy fell apart". That's the idea. Wow. Anenvironment was slowly killing him... now THAT's original and worthwatching.This is the first Fasbinder's film I've seen... I've heard that he's agenius of mise-en-scene, but I've seen student films with moreattention, inspiration, idea, and craft than this... this.... thisnothing. It has nothing!Each and every shot is too long. There's so much emptiness in them...The acting's horrible. You can see the actors had no preparation atall, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt at showingemotions... it's so... superficial... The lines are so explicative thatyou could removed 90% of them and still have the same crappy film.Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere, dynamics, that's for pussies!One shot per scene, 80% of the time people staring unrealistically,having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the momentbesides hollow staring at the camera or one another... EDiting? Allrules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay-off of anykind... Photography? Half of the shots have reflection in them, andcrappy lighting with no stylization of any kind. Shadows, play ofshadows... who needs that? We need a guy pissing, drinking, hitting hiswife like he's... like he's acting. We need a bunch of close ups of anot-so-beautiful woman... we need an amateurish climax of his captureby an unconvincing arabian torturer... This film has so much wrongsthat it isn't worth the no-budget it had.Frankly, I haven't seen a film this bad since American Pie 5. Yup. Thatbad.I've just started watching his "Veronica Foss" movie, which seems muchbetter, based on the first 15 minutes (since it does have a hint ofdirecting and artistic idea, unlike this crap), so I won't argue thatFasbinder's clueless.... but this.... this film SUCKS!
