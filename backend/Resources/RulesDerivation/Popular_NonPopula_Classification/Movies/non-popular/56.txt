Dick Harper (George Segal) is suddenly fired from his high-paying job.There's a recession going on and he can't find another. His wife Jane(Jane Fonda) tries to help but she fails in every job she gets. Finallythey turn to robbery to make ends meet...and it works!Silly (as you can tell by the premise) but watchable. I never reallylaughed or found it funny but I did smile quite a few times. What makesthis worth seeing is Segal and Fonda--they're both just fantastic. Theygive very relaxed, believable performances. They also are great atcomedy and play off each other very well. Fonda in particular seems tobe enjoying herself. Another plus (or minus, depending on your view)are some truly horrible 70s fashions and decor. Check out some ofJane's outfits and look at the wallpaper in their bedroom! Alsointeresting to see Ed McMahon as Segals' boss. The only real bad thingsare a few ugly, needless, homophobic lines and a transsexual set up asa joke. But that was all acceptable back in the 70s.Mild but worth catching.
