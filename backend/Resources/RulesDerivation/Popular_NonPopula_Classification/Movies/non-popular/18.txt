I\'m not a big fan of this movie. First of all, it\'s ridiculously slow togetting to the point. And when it does, you\'re highly disappointed for itmaking you wait for such nonsense. Maybe because I\'m of a Protestantdenomination, that this movie is not all that kosher with me. Priests can\'tget you into Heaven, you and Jesus can. And second, them using the wholeJesus pardoned the thief before he died, so therefore men can eat otherpeople\'s sins is just sheer idiocy. If you read the Bible, it said JESUSpardoned him. He didn\'t give no man authority to pardon other people fromtheir sins. For the first time, I was on the Catholics side, only cuz theywere against this order. However, I don\'t agree that confessing to a man whosins himself everyday is gonna get you "absolution" or pave the path forHeaven. The movie was just underdeveloped and wrong on top of all that. Ilike religious movies like "Stigmata" and so forth, but this is just boringand horrible as a film. It goes beyond the fact that I don\'t agree with it.I gave the film 1/2 an hour and went on to watch Braveheart instead becausemy boyfriend and I despised the film so much to that point. I came back toit really believing it went somewhere only to have my hopes dashed. Please,spare yourself this film. There\'s better films on this subject. I\'m notAnti-Catholic, so don\'t start emailing me over it. I just don\'tagree.
