What we have with the Sin Eater is really the middle of a trilogy. It\'s likewatching "The Empire Strikes Back" without watching the other two. Manyquestions without answers and answers without questions. The end hints at asequel which any watcher knows will never materialise.The story is about two priests of a dying order and their dealings with theeponymous Sin Eater and other more ethereal dark forces. Yes, it is a littleslow, and in my opinion Not at all confusing. Heath Ledger is good atportraying the strength and vulnerability of Alex, Shannyn Sossamon as Marathe fragile/injured/beautiful soul who is the greater threat to Alex\'s faithand Mark Addy\'s Thomas who\'s only real disappointment is the "accent". As anorthern lass I would like to know why his priest hadn\'t come from Yorkshire(we do have them here as well you know).There was a realism and a depth to this film as some more preceptivereviewers have discovered. As for the others they skimmed the surface andnaturally it disappointed them which is fair enough, Not all films talk toall people on the same level.In summation in my opinion and as written on many a school report card - NotBad Could\'ve Tried Harder
