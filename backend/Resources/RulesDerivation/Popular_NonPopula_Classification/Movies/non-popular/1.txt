This show is stupid.The acting is putrid and so over the top it makes me want to puke in mymouth.The writing is about as funny as you would expect from a group ofschool children who watched a real TV show then were told to do aproject on it.I see no point at all to this show and don't see why in the world theywould have actually thought anyone would want to see it, what issupposed to be the draw? The characters weren't just totally unfunnythey weren't even interesting to me.A huge swing-and-a-miss.
