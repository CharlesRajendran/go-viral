The real stars in this version is the food. I never cared much forBobby Flay or Mario Batali. What is annoying is the mainstays seem towin most of the time! Are there other chefs who can participate otherthen Flay, Batali and Cat Cora? Are some of the judges for real?? Imean the challengers are top class chefs and they get beaten by FoodNetwork celebrities?? Pathetic! It's a gross example of this thingcalled BIAS. However I do get a kick of finding out what the secretingredients are and how and what will be the results. That is why Iwatch the show. It's the challenge of creating dishes the everydaypeople dream of eating in only one hour. As for the supportingcharacters are they OK but Mark Dacascos sometimes look like he'sbuttering up to the Iron Chefs with comments like "Iron Chef it is anhonor seeing you work." This show could be better if other chefs notaffiliated with the Food Network are given the chance of wearing themantle of Iron Chef from time to time and the judges be more fairotherwise Iron Chef: America is nothing more than an ego contest ofFood Network mainstays against everyone on the outside. What a pity itwill stay that way.
