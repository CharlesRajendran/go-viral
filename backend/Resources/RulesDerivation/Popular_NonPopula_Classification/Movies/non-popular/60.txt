See it Â– Don't expect too much action in this one. It's about a wagontrain on the Oregon trail, but most of the conflict comes from within.So why see it? First of all, the cast is an all star lineup includingKirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Richard Widmark, and a young adorableSally Fields. Unfortunately, there may be too many actors, because wedon't really get to know any of them very well. A second reason to seeit is because it is much darker than most films during this time. Theending is pretty dark and there is a love affair that occurs that isharmless by today's movie standards but no doubt pushed the envelopeback in the 60's. I would compare it to a movie like "Major Dundee"because it has great veteran actors but only a few memorable moments.Rent don't buy. 2 action rating
