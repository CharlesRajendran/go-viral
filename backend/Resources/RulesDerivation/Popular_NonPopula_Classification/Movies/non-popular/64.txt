This particular picture I seemed to have missed and did not realize thegreat veteran actors who showed up in this film. This is a tale aboutthe West and the very realistic life of having to travel in a bumpyhard seat Covered Wagon to Oregon along with flying arrows from NativeAmericans. Kirk Douglas, (Sen. William J. Tadlock),"Bad & TheBeautiful,\'52, had a big mouth in this picture and even had a friendbeat him with a whip. Robert Mitchem, (Dick Summers),"Cape Fear",\'62,gave an outstanding performance but really didn\'t belong in this film.Richard Widmark,(Lije Evans),"Kiss of Death",\'47, was a pretty toughguy and has some very good fight scenes and seemed to knock himself outplaying this role. Sally Field,(Mercy McBee),"Hooper",\'78, played avery young girl, as she appeared in this picture, who got married andhad a very nice surprise for her mom & dad and the entire town whoattended the marriage ceremony. All these actors must have had acontract to full fill and I think they all wondered why they had toperform in this so called WESTERN.
