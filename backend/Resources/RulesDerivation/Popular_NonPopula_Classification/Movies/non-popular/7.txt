That was a very interesting movie in many ways. It was considerablybetter than I had hoped for, although just why anyone would want tocast the sweet and innocent Mr Heath as a brooding priest is quitebeyond me. There were some small but grating details ofcharacter-underdevelopment happening, one bad enough to have me shoutaloud, "scripting error! oh no!".But it was entertaining, the original idea was very interesting andthey did try with it, gave it a good shot.I might re-make that one day with a totally different cast when I getto own my own film studio.
