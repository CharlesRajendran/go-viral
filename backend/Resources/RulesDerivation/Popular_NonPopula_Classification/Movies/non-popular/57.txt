The best thing about Dick & Jane is the music, like the main theme by TheMovie \'Ahead of the Game\', and as some of it\'s supplied by Lamont Dozierit\'s not hard to see why.  There are funny scenes, like when the foodstampstechnician turns up at their home, during the one night that they canaffordsteak and champaign for dinner, and he refuses their offer of food saying;\'No thanks. I had a Big Mac...And a Coke.\' But it\'s all a bit too smug andpompous and \'Oh aren\'t we all sooo funny.\' for it\'s own good.For a better movie that utilises Ms Fonda better, check Nine to Five(1980).Seagal is better in A Touch Of Class with Glenda Jackson.
