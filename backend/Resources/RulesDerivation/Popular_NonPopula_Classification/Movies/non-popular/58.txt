I can\'t really say what\'s wrong with this film, but it really didn\'t hold myinterest. Nothing at all wrong with the performances by Segal, Fonda, orMcMahon. The direction and photography were fine. I guess that means it wasthe script, although I didn\'t notice anything wrong with it at the time. Ihave nothing specifically bad to say about it, I just didn\'t enjoy it much.
