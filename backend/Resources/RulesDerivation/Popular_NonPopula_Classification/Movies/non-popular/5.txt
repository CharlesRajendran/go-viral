This is an excellent and long awaited true successor to The Exorcist.Forget all the sequels, this is it.Once you get past the low production values, and the sometimesridiculously clichéd dialogue, you have a movie that is intelligent,creative and breaks new ground in the horror movie genre.It is almost as if someone took the theme of The Exorcist, and went fora walk on the wild side in the Marvel Universe.I endured the beginning of this movie, which didn\'t seem promising, andthe cliché\'d dialogue. But then I thought - maybe this actually bringsyounger viewers up to date with the more common place ideas of westernphilosophy (mainly Nietsche).However, when the Dark Pope tells the priest "ask the dying man",things take off and we\'re leaving prudish Hollywood morality farbehind.I hadn\'t seen Shannyn Sossamon before, but she is very appealing andfeminine. Great use of the Italian locations. The cliché of the priestwho falls for a beautiful young woman FOR ONCE isn\'t just there \'justbecause\', but is an integral part of the plot.Highly recommended for all lovers of the horror movie genre. And allCatholic folk who got their freak on watching The Exorcist. This is nota movie that tries to scare by just presenting knife wielding killersin hockey masks, but with the horror of ideas, and fate.With all the boring "horror" movies (teen slashers, etc.) being made,here finally is someone who isn\'t afraid to dig into religious andancient history to find new material. The same happened in Dracula 2000- please keep it going.
