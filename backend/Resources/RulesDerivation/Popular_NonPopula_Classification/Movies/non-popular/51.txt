That\'s about the best that I can come with, and that is a goodthing...just a pleasant film. I watched it on On Demand the other nightfor the first time since I originally saw it on cable back in 1978. Iwas a teen ager who wanted to write movies, and this is one of thefilms that I recorded onto an audio cassette to listen to over and overagain to help with my visualization.There is nothing overly funny about it, it doesn\'t leave me institches, but I do smile a lot while watching it. It is alsointeresting to see some of the old bit players from the 70s who haveeither died off (Anne Ramsay) or stopped getting work. For some reason,it is a pleasure to watch. I think there is a sense of livingvicariously through this couple that makes it enjoyable to watch.Seeing it as an adult, there are jokes that I now get that I didn\'t asa pre-teen, but it is still a film that I would let a child watch. It\'sentertaining...nothing I can overtly say than that it is anentertaining movie, and I am interested to see what Jim Carrey does tothe remake.
