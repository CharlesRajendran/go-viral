This movie could have been a lot of things. The title itself is a improperlytitled movie. The real title should have been "The Other" because it wastalking about a theme that has been in old horror stories and legends andthat\'s on the theory of a "sineater" who provides salvation to the "sinful"person that the Church doesn\'t offer to that particular person. There havebeen references to this in smokey mountain stories, and even in an old"Twilight Zone". There were too many confusing happenings in this particularmovie and not enough of the horror that is involved in the theory of"sineating". I was unable to determine what the "Order" was but did hearmany references to "The Other" who was the sineater. No explanation wasoffered as to why the priest was recruited to be the sineater and why the"other" was leaving those duties. In the mountain legends it was usually asa result of the sineater dying and the unfortunate son became the sineaterby default.Maybe worth watching, but not as good or as scary as it could havebeen.
