this film is a great disappointment to those who enjoy westerns.2 out of 10. the boredom i got out of watching this film was so immense iliterally fell asleep for real! the way west is so boring anddreary that it should be banned !! ok maybe that is too drastic,buthonestly, for you western movie lovers, take my advice and do notwatchthe way west if you have not already...boredom is one word to sumitall up.
