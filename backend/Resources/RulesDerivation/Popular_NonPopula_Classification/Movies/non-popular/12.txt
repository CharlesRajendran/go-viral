The movie does not suck. The movie is however very different, sodifferent that through out production major changes were forced intothe film. If something isn\'t grabbing at the audience every five minsproducers get worried. This film could have been much better if theproducers were just left out of the making of this film. The reason theexorcist is so great is because the beginning let\'s you be. It isn\'tconstantly grabbing at you, it slowly leads you instead. when you watchthe order you have to kind of filter out the producers additions to thefilm. Watch for acting, plot, framing, and color, and try to ignore theconstant nagging cgi demons and random barking dogs. the story is veryadult, as in adult interests and attention span but random dumb partshave been thrown in. This is a big problem today. In Martin Scorsese\'sGangs of New York he is constantly reminding us with flash backs whothe characters were in the beginning of the movie. The problem is theyassume all audiences are dumb. Never again will we get truly greatmovies, because producers assume we don\'t have the intelligence or thepatients. It\'s forced greats to dumb down their material.Anyway watch for Heath\'s amazing acting job as a priest. Watch how hehandles the rosary when him and his friend discuss Shannyn Sossamnon\'scharacter, it\'s just like Brando and the glove in On The Waterfront.Shannyn is amazing too, painting with her hands. If you can see past the dumb lures and really become interested in themystery it really can carry you away. It\'s kind of like Angel heart.
