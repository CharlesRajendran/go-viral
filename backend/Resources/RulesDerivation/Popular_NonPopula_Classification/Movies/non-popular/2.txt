This was a very bad show, it is very disappointing because all of theactors on it seem like they are probably nice people in real life butthe show was just really bad.I think the problem was more the bad writing with terrible situations,jokes, dialogue, none of it was believable and everything was sopredictable that of course none of it was funny.The actors weren't bad but when the show was so awful there obviouslyis no way it can be saved just by good acting anyway. I thought theshow just looked and seemed cheap, and like they did not actually tryto make a good show.Bad show.
