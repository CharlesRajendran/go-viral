This movie was nothing but a huge disappointment. The ideas it hitsupon; Catholicism, religion, redemption, are all interesting andapproached in a unique way. However the dialogue and poor acting ruinanything that might have made this movie halfway decent. ShannynSossamon couldn\'t emote her way out of a paper bag, and lord does itshow. Mark Addy tries his hardest to save it, but to no avail. I stilldon\'t understand where this movie was supposed to go. Because where itarrives is just a huge disappointment. The end leaves you wondering ifthey are going to attempt a sequel of some sort. Something along thelines of The Crow. I hope to god they don\'t.
