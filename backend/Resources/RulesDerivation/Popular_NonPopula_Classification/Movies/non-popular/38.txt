What a waste. So many things could have been done to make this movie a winner, but instead, it simply became crap. They should have released it as The Sineater instead of rename it after some Jean Claude Van Damme castoff. The performances were all subpar and average, for even the enchanting Shannyn Sossamon and the ultra-cool Peter Weller looked lost and confused. Heath Ledger took the cake in regards to being miscast in a role. Maybe they should have shelved this movie and made Knight\'s Tale 2. It would have certainly been less obnoxious.
