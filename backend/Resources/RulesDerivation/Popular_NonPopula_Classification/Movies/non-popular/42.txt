This movie was supposed to make you think- is God always right inpunishingpeople for their sins? It sure made me think. This movie was not supposedtobe a work of genius, of majesty, or of excellence, it was simply a moviemade to answer a question, which it accomplished successfully.It was not made to bash the Catholic Church; it was not made to relinquishit. It was simply a movie based on someone\'s ideas, a film to entertain.Itentertained me, and it did not bother me in any way that it was addressingsomething that every foolish American is bent on fighting over - religion.If it bothers people so much that other people have different views on Godand humanity, why do they watch it? The answer is simple: they are lookingfor something to fight over. The movie did address some controversialpoints, such as the existence of a God, etc., but almost every moviebringsup religion in some way, shape, or form. Just because a movie is solelybased upon it, people feel the need to start trouble. Just because a moviedoesn\'t have the same beliefs/understandings as you, it doesn\'t mean thatyou shouldn\'t enjoy it, or accept the fact that someone has differentfeelings. But people always seem to take everything to heart. That\'s justthe reality of it.In short, this movie was not terrible. It had an interesting storyline,andI believe that everyone should appreciate it, as long as they have an openmind. The actors were all chosen well, and while it could\'ve been a bitlonger and more detailed in explaining the relationships that all of thecharacters had, it had an average movie duration. The movie was confusingatseveral points, and all things were not explained at the end, however,mostof it was. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an open mind forsupernatural thrillers.
