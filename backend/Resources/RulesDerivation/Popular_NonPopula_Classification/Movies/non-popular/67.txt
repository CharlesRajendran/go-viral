Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring this down.Flay being the worst. Definitely a one trick pony, I think they couldhave gotten other American chefs to come to the table on this one asthe Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duo come up with really...don'treflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don'tthink Batali even went to chef school, actually. There are a lot ofgreat chefs in America, I just wonder why they don't appear on the FoodNetwork.It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhapsco-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is abit too flippant/funny for this role.
