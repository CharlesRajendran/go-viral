It took a while to kick in and once it did, you took to it on acautious level. At first, you feel another treatment of Bergman'smasterpiece, SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973 - Sweden), is developing whena couple spend a fair bit of time rambling about their maritalproblems. Whereas Bergman tends to be very analytical this was basic.Nothing fascinating because it was realistic. The mirror has beenturned on the audience as we watch every detail in awkward humanemotions spill for the camera. Nothing dramatic. Just simplicity andhonesty via jumps cuts and long durational shots. Then for the good ofthe movie it takes another turn, giving us little surprises. Veryreminiscent of Claude Sautet's CHOSES DE LA VIE, LES (1969 - France).
