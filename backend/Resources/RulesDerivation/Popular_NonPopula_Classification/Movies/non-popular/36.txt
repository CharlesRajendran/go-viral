In New York, Alex Bernier (Ledger) is a young priest and one of thethree last members of an arcane order called Carolingians. When the oldleader of the order dies, Alex goes to Rome with his friend MaraSinclair (Shannyn Sossamon), a troubled painter who tried suicide inthe past and for whom Alex is in love with. Thomas Garret (Mark Addy),the other member of the Carolingians, meets them in Rome. Alex notesthat the body of the old priest bears two marks on the chest and afurther investigation reveals that they are the symbol of the \'SinEater\', a renegade priest called William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann) whoexchanges absolution per money. Lots of mystery surrounds Alex, Maraand Thomas while they stay in Rome. This movie has a good premise,cast, director, photography, budget, locations, but something ismissing or does not work well, and in the end the plot is very confusedand quite boring. A waste of a good idea. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \'Devorador de Pecado\' (\'Sin Eater\')
