I\'ll start with what I liked about this movie. I think it has a greatmain story which could have made a cool creepy version of The Name ofthe Rose if it had played in around 1300.But it hadnt. This takes me to the parts I didn\'t like. The charactersare unbelievable and the situations they get in make no sense. Thebasic plot has been heavily overloaded with strange sub plots and long,boring and repeating dialogs.At half time I first thought about stopping the movie and going to bedbut I just couldn\'t get off the couch. Don\'t bother.Zuluu
