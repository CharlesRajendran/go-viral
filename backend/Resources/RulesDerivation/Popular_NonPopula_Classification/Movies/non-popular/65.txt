Can someone tell me please what is Kevin Brauch job on this show.he isnot funny no charisma whatsoever He tried to be funny he fails He tryto show that he is fluent with foreign languages and he fails I thinkAlton brown can do his job and Kevin's job combined. He is annoying andhe force me to change the channel . And the cheap pretentious chairman,why is he there? This is not an action movie... And do us a favor andwork on your accent. The only person I respect on this show is Altonbrown . And I noticed that bobby flay is the golden boy... But he suckshe is a one trick pony nothing else. And one last thing non Americanchefs lose most of the time....and sometimes it's bullshit
