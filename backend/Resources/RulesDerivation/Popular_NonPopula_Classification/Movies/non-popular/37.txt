This film had the possibility to at least entertain but instead it tankedinto a boring formula vampire film.  I wouldn\'t even suggest looking atthison a Sunday night when there is nothing else on TV, its that bad.  Itconcerns a priest (Ledger in a miscast role) and his attempt to find outabout a "sin eater" played by a German actor who was in a few German hitswho can\'t speak English and he\'s dull and boring.  There is no emotionalresponse in the film, it does nothing at all.  ....
