I thought this movie was just okay. I often tape movies off cable and thensit on them for months, until I have a free couple of hours to watch them. Itaped \'Fun With Dick and Jane\' nearly four years before I actually watchedit. I usually refer to Leonard Maltin before I get my hopes up. He only gavethis **Â½  so I was in no real hurry to see it. But I like Jane Fonda andGeorge Segal so I figured I would watch it SOMEday. Well, I finally poppedit in last week and after a half an hour I was, like, can we get on with theplot now? Then at that point I cracked open Maltin and he wrote that itstarts out great, but gets worse from there. This gets worse?! I gave it alittle more of a chance and I thought it got better as it wenton.The plot is simple. The husband loses his job and their suburban lifestyleis threatened to be taken away from them. That\'s the whole story, stretchedout for an hour and forty minutes. Segal applies for unemployment benefits,food stamps, etc. Fonda attempts to get a job, blah, blah, blah. The two ofthem eventually turn to crime when they encounter some criminals as they aretrying to borrow money from a finance company. They see how easy it is andbecause they are yuppies they get quite good at it. It\'s a good rainy daymovie or something to watch when you have insomnia. Nothingmore.I was, however, surprised at the scene where Fonda squats on the toilet topee as she talks casually with Segal. It just looked out of place watchingher wipe up afterwards, yucch!
