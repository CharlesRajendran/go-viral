In an age where nothing but Bruckheimer films will be watched, some of uswant an intelligent movie.  This is a good one.  People complaining thatthey don\'t like this movie, are probably the same people complaining thatthey didn\'t like Vanilla Sky or Fallen.  They just don\'t get it.  Thismovieis smart, thought provoking, and original (not counting TV shows).   Theacting is good, not counting Peter Weller, who should have stayed in hisRobocop phase, because it\'s obviously all he\'s fit to do.I\'ve seen so many people complain about Brian Hegeland\'s use of cast beingthe same as A Knight\'s Tale, but nobody seems to complain when it\'s DannyBoyle using Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccelston over and over again (Idon\'t, simply because I love Danny Boyle\'s work, as well).  Hitchcock didthe same thing.  Ingred Bergman and Cary Grant were in more of their fairshare of Hitchcock films.  Nobody cared.I think it\'s a person\'s right to not like this movie, that\'s fine.  AndI\'lladmit, that the movie was a bit slow in some points, but as a whole, thismovie was excellent.  I\'m just sticking by my theory that the people thatdidn\'t like it are the same people that hate every other "thinking" movieout there, as well.I\'ll give you a tip:  If you want to see explosions and lots of gore anddeath, go see a cheesy slasher film, or a crap action film with noplot....if you want to see an intelligent movie, see this one.  Those ofyouwith an IQ over a certain point will probably enjoy it, and theconversations that it will bring up.
