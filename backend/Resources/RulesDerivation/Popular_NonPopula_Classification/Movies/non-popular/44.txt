I missed this one at the theaters since it disappeared so fast.  Afterrenting it, it is easy to see why it flopped--it is a disordered mess! Let\'stick off the problems:  indifferent acting, ludicrous plot, choppy editingand incompetent direction.  Many viewers have detailed problems with thismovie including the scene where Heath Ledger fights off 2 demons and thenshrugs it off as nothing special!  That gives you some idea of how stupidthis movie is.  To sum up:  no chills, no story, don\'t bother! 4/10
