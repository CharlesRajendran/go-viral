Amusing, occasionally hilarious satire lambasting the hypocrisies ofAmerican capitalism. This deft comedy pokes fun at the aerospace industry,the welfare system, and may be one of the first to harpoon televangelism.Segal and Fonda are a great team, and the movie ages surprisingly well.JayLeno makes an early cameo as a construction worker; Dick and Jane earns 3and a half (out of five) on the Corky-meter.
