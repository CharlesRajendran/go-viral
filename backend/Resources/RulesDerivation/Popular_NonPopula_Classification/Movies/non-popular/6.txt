Being interested in anything mysterious or arcane, I was drawn to thismovie by the title alone, and I felt the promise was delivered. Thecinematography was excellent - the shadowy underworld of Rome, theantique look, really gave it a creepy feel. While some of thecharacters were not explained in depth, I didn\'t think they needed tobe - their actions and words alone indicate their history, as dark andshadowed as it is, and no further explanation is needed.While there were a few predictable lines, delivered in a predictablemanner, the movie was excellent. It certainly had an indulgent feel toit on behalf of the director, but his indulgence only proved thebenefit of the overall effect of the film.8 out of 10.
