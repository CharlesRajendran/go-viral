There\'s too many people bitching at this one, but i likedit.Of course the well-known-thriller-formula is present (who killed...?) butthis is for sure a very original script, the idea is great. The acting isgood (specially on William Eden character); some interesting elements arepresent and yes, with some scenes you scare the hell out ofit.Some time the dialogs are quite obvious but there\'s interesting lines too.Iguess it all depends if you like this kind of genre.Worth watching, go rent it!
