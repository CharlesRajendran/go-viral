I rented the movie at the local library, since I had years earlier seenAngst Essen Die Seele Auf, and liked it.It started very interesting with Hans Epp returning from a spell with theForeign Legion, but the first thing his mother told him was how he was afailure and always would be. "Was ist traurig VorMittag ist noch traurigNachMittag" But I found the actors in this movie to be like zombies. It might be thatthey just depicted a dreary every day life, but I felt midways into the filmthat I don`t need to have these pictures inside my head, so I pressed thestop button and in stead put on the other film I had rented at the library,an episode of Star Trek Voyager.Not that this is a bad movie, it was just tragic to watch at thetime.
