let me start out by saying that i didn\'t see any of the trailers for thisfilm so i wasn\'t sure what to expect. however i went to imdb and looked oversome of the reviews and found its average of 5 so i didn\'t expect much but iwas surprised at what i got. the reviews i saw of this film were wrong. itis better then what it got. i really enjoyed the story line and the specialeffects. the effects were not overly impressive but they did the job. thisfilm really makes you think. and it has several unexpected twists to it. onething i did not like of this film is it was so dark. i know it helped to setthe mood of the movie but i still would have liked to see a little better. iread several reviews that this film is a C- but i really liked it and willprobably see it again just to get the details a little better. so as far asi\'m concerned i give this film at least B+.
