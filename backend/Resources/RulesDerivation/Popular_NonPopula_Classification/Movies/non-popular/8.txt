Hi, I\'m a philosophy major and the University of Wisconsin Fox Valleyand i plan going on to Seminary to become a Priest. I have a very deepinterest in theology and the Occult. The minute i heard about thisfilm, i saw it right away opening weekend and i was blown away. I\'venever seen a film that dealt with these issues and i was waiting for solong. The film really got deep into the conspiracy of the CatholicChurch, involvement with the Occult and the true face of Good and Evil.The inside mechanics of the film are excellent. The film paces itselfand builds you right up to the explosive ending. the problem is theoutside mechanics are so loose, at times it\'s almost laughable. MarkAddy\'s performance is so inconsitent you almost find yourself laughingat his remarks ( the demon chasing scene is just a mess where a demongets run over by a truck and fades away and Addy then gets a call onhis cell phone from Ledger\'s character!)So my suggestion is when you\'rewatching the film, think about the story itself and you\'ll bepleasantly surprised."Knowledge is the enemy of Faith" 8/10
