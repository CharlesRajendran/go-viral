This could have been a good movie if it had a different director, adifferent lead actor and a different script about somethingelse.The concept of a sin eater was fairly interesting, but thewriter/director/producer forgot to make a movie about that and insteadgaveus an evil Pope wannabe, a stereotypical drunk, jolly priest and to top itoff decided to cast Ledger in the lead role which ended up proving onceandfor all that he really can\'t act.
