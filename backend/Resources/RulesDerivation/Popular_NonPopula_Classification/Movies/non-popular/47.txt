What kind I say about this movie. well for starters, I thought that thisfilm was okay, not the greatest not worst.  I said this cause I thoughtthatthe script was great and original, really different and refreshing.  Now Iwouldn\'t say that it\'s the greatest film that I\'ve seeing cause of theacting.  The actors that played each role, seems that they played themwithout emotions, as if they took the life out of them.  When the wifelaughed or cried, this didn\'t look real to me for some reason, that\'s justan example, but sincerely all the characters didn\'t act real at all.  IwishI could say more positive things about this film so you guys can see it atleast once but how can I do that since I know that I\'m not going to seethismovie again.  I rented this film from the library of my school, withouthearing anything about the film itself or the director.  I took a chancebecause the story that was describe on the back sounded really interestingand it really was.
