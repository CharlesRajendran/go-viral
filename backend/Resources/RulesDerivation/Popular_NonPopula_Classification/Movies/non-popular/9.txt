While I love to post about great movies,I think it is more fun to ripthe really BAD movies to shreds,and boy is this a turkey!!where tobegin?how about the plot! there are so many inconsistencies in thismovie,plot holes you could fall into,acting,can I use that word iwonder,anyway other reviewers are right about it being so dark,most ofthe scenes are shot either in Dark apartments or underground in secretcabalistic torch lit caverns I must say i enjoyed Peter Weller(robocop) as a Cardinal,very menacing and the chubby English bloke wasa sympathetic character but you got the idea Heath was just like theproverbial porn star,laid back and thought of the cheque,because hisprescence in this movie is non existent!Ned Kelly suited him,you couldbelieve he was a handsome young rogue but this movie is abysmal forhim,since The Patriot,in which he shined I have kept a look out for himbut I feel he will be the Corey Haim of the noughties!
