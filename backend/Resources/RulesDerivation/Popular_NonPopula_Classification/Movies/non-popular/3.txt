The Order tells the story of Fr. Alex (Heath Ledger) who seeks the SinEater. Very interesting story, if this movie got a lot of bad reviews,it\'s probably because they are fewer worshipers in God as predicted bythe Irish prophet Malachie today, and people think this is nonsense. Inevery existing faith on earth, each representing God at differentperspectives, the Devil is present in all of us, so is God, The Ordertakes you to the point in between good and evil as seen by the Catholicperspective.What makes this movie mysterious would be the flat beat in the end ofthe movie, showing the ending credits, played in the bar in the middleof the film, too. If this movie got bad reviews, people are scared ofGod and His will, they shouldn\'t be.Amen !
