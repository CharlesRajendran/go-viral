Hard for me to find the real place of this movie. I found the ideas in thescript extremely odd and incoherent. Catholicism, mysticism, all these sayme nothing, but I do acknowledge that they can be background for goodscripts and good films. Still, this is not the case with \'Sin Eater\' and itcannot be the case when visual effects try to represent the most abstractand spiritual entity that can be - the human soul as some kind of cold steamexiting the mouth of a dying person. Brrrrh...Amazingly, the author of the script and director of the movie is BrianHelgeland, who wrote scripts for a few better movies - \'Mystic River\',\'Conspiracy Theory\', \'Postman\'. Should he remained in the religious historicthriller field, maybe he would have chances to be more successful. Hehowever wanted to say much more, and the result is pathetic.However, the director Brian Helgeland saves part of what the script writerBrian Helgeland failed to achieve. The film is quite well done, reasonablyacted, has pace and atmosphere for much of the time. The result is an oddcombination, with incredibly bad moments but not bad taste and repulsingoverall. If you are in Catholicism dogma debates, or mysticism, you may everenjoy it. 5/10 on my personal scale.
