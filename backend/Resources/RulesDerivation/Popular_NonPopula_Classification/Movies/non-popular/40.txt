I thought this was a good movie. The actors in this movie worked goodtogether. I think the movie was interesting and made you think. It madeyou open your mind up to be more aware of what could happen and whatpeople believe as true or untrue. It makes you look at the CatholicReligion in a different light. You also feel for the characters in thismovie and you want to understand what they are trying to do and believein. It was a very well done movie and Heath Legder has grown as anactor. Shannyn Sommason has grown as a actor too. They both have goodchemistry as actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who waswilling to watch something different, and you enjoy B movies with goodactors, as I do, I strongly recommend this movie to you.
