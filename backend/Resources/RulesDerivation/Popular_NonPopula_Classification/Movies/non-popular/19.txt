What a load of pretentious crap this movie was.  Bad, cheesy, ridiculous,overly dramatic dialogue, a plot that moved slower than molasses inwinter,stagnant effects and artsy-fartsy camera work...and not a movie anywheretobe found. The story was so ridiculously complex that it collapsed in onitself much like the scaffolding in the Sistine Chapel. The actors are allso busy trying to keep straight faces whilst spouting pseudo-Shakespereanlines that their characters don\'t have a chance to come to life beforetheydie.  It was just a muddled mess with a lot of nice, moodyscenery.The only good part of the entire viewing experience was seeing theseriouslyunderrated, underused and incredibly riveting Richard Bremmer in athrowawayrole as the owner of a dank and creepy bookstore.  Other than that, thisfilm was a big boring waste of my time.
