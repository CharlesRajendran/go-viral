I didn\'t really care for this movie.  Much of it made no sense. I finallyfigured out the Sin Eater recruited Heath Ledger(Alex) to take his place. At first Alex doesn\'t want to do it, but is sort of tricked into becomingthe Sineater.  The way the Sineater gives the person absolution was ratherdull and not creative. That part could have been done much better.  And whenAlex is brought to this underground cult by his priest friend, that partmade no sense. It was like they hang someone and that person could answer aquestion, and they gave that person a demon-like voice. I didn\'t getit. And this movie had a disturbing love scene between Alex, a priest, and hisgirl. I mean, couldn\'t they have waited till he\'d taken his priest\'s collaroff and declared he wasn\'t a priest any more before showingthat.And the whole movie moves very slowly. It feels like 3 hours instead of 100minutes.  FINAL VERDICT: Don\'t bother watching this. It is not scary and moves at asnail\'s pace.
