The film was a decent one but to get the movie goer in the mood it washardto see certain scenes.They were just not bright enough to see theexpressions of the persons face or what they were doing at times....Idon\'tthink they needed to do that the concept of weird and mystical was therewith the story...I would recommed this as a cult film and for those thatlove the weird dark and hard to follow type movie..
