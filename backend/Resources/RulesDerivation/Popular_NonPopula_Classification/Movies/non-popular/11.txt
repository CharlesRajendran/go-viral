I\'m not usually one to not finish a movie but I think I made it halfway through this one before making the executive decision to turn itoff. It could have been quite interesting but none of the characters weredeveloped properly. The lines were delivered with no conviction so Iactually felt myself laughing at very "serious" parts. For example when"Mara" is telling the priest why she committed suicide. I usually find something good in every movie but there was absolutelynothing in this one. Plus Heath Ledger\'s character looked way too youngto have amassed the depth of knowledge that they were eluding to in themovie. The Mara character shows up at his church, the police comelooking for her and she manages to secure her passport after escapingfrom a mental institution to go to Italy?
