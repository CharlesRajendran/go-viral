it's too bad that it has to be such a male dominated, ego driven andsexist show. have you noticed that a woman will rarely win against aniron chef?? have you also noticed that the panel has only one womanjudge and two men?? no wonder the men iron chef always win. also, haveyou noticed how many women iron chef are out there??? I so wonder aboutthis show and the food industry... just like another male dominatingindustry, men grabbed the power and will never give it to women. but inreality, women cook at home in almost every family, so you tell me howcome men are always on top in iron chef and top chef shows...? theanswer is simple, it's a sexist field.
