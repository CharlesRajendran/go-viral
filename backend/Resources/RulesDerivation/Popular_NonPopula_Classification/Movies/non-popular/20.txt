 So Keats said and it still remains evident today. I found this movie impressive. I\'m glad this wasn\'t some big budget film to grab the mainstreamaudience. And though there were some flaws with this film the concepts inthis story rang clear. I was interested throughout and still managed toremain interested even as I talked on the phone. I hope there is room for asequel.I can try to discuss and defend this movie so much but who cares. The pointis, I got its message, I liked that it cut the formalities and gave me astory to think about. It wasn\'t too deep for me to get and if you alreadyhave a Faith then it shouldn\'t bother you.
