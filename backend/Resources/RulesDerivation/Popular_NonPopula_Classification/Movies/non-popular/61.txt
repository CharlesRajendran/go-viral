This film had all to come out as a fine western: big budget, top stars,impressive outdoor locations, great color photography, acceptablestories around the main plot, interesting characters, action scenes andso on. But its a fact it didn't make it and turned out as just anaverage product and in my opinion director Andrew MacLaglen has to dowith it.MacLaglen never was a very imaginative director. He just sort of pushedhis films ahead following the scripts and taking no risks at all byincluding some personal touches or feelings; that's why it is hard tofind really bad pictures in his filmography but you also won't findhigher than average films either (other examples are "The Undefeated"with John Wayne and Rock Hudson; "The Last Hard Men" with ChartonHeston, James Coburn and Barbara Hershey; "The Sea Wolves" with GregoryPeck, David Niven and Roger Moore). "The Way West" is a classicalMacLaglen movie, just standard, average and light with no big flaws andno major highlights either.Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark and Robert Mitchum are good but wasted inthe leading parts. Sally Field's early role as a young girl too avidfor man's favors showed she had talent and a promising career shecertainly fulfilled.All in all, "The Way West" is just for western fans to spend a coupleof hours without much expectations.
