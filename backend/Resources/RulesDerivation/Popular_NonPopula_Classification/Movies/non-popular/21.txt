Without giving away any of the story, I would like to say that if you areinterested in movies that make you think about good and evil, and thatmaybethere is a HUGE chunk of gray, then you should see this movie.  Thestoryline, while admittedly choppy in parts, was original andthought-provoking.  I thought that Heath Ledger\'s performance was good,aswell as Mark Addy and Shannon Sossamyn (although, I have seen herbetter).There are A LOT of mixed reviews on this one, but if you liked "AKnight\'sTale", bear in mind that this was written by the same director andperformedby three of the main actors.  The genre is different and there is lesshumor, but it is a deeper movie.  Like I said, see it and decide foryourself.  :)
