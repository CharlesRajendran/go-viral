...and then writer/director/co-producer Brian Helgeland (Oscarwinner forL.A. Confidential\'s script) starts to get us, or at least me, to not caretoo much about the fate(s) of the main players.  Even Shannyn Sossmann,whoseems the most intriguing of the characters (Heath Ledger was onlysatisfactorily convincing) as Mara the artist who\'s had mental anguish attimes, starts to loose interest all too soon.There is a story worth telling here, and it begins as such: Ledger playsAlex Bernier, a priest working by himself for the past years, is one ofthelast of his order of Carolingians (I\'ve never heard of them, but thenagainI\'m not of the Catholic faith), and is summoned to Rome to investigate thesuicide (or possible murder) of his leader.  When he gets there, he findsthat things of the supernatural were at work with his master\'s death, anditinvolves a "sin-eater" who can take away the sins and send a person toheaven without the proper means from the official Church.This basic story seemed sufficient enough for a religious/horror film fromthe previews, possibly as in the vein of 1999\'s Stigmata, and yet when itbegan to take off it sputtered disappointingly into dialog that tried tobeamusing when it shouldn\'t of been and delivered occasional visual effectsthat were muddled and dim.  To sum up Helgeland\'s "The Order", it has agoodmovie in it somewhere, and the ideas were a little intelligent fortheologists, however it wasn\'t executed in that way.  Grade:C-
