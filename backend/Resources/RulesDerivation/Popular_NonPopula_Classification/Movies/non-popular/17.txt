I accidentally rented this film in my video store. I really don\'t knowwhathappened to me that day. Maybe I was bedazzled by the beauty of ShannynSossamon. I will learn from that mistake from now on. The film it self isamasterpiece of trash. I especially liked the part where we first meetfatherThomas. He chases some guy down the street and screams at him to go backtohell. The guy is then ran over by a truck. Where did the driver go??? Andfather Thomas acts like this is something so usual. And it turns out thatitis. It seems that the world is full of demons and brave fathers Alex andThomas save us from them. Oh yeah, father Thomas uses bad language aswell.F**K is to him like Good morning. So, I urge everyone not to watch thisforthe love of God.
