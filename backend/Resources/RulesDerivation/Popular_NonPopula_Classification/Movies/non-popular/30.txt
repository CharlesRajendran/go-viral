I was very surprised by this movie. After reading all the bad press andreviews, I thought this movie might be pretty bad. On the contrary, itsaddens me to see The IQ of people anymore. If a movie doesn\'t have oneliners and lots of action for the moron, it sucks. Go see this movie ifyouwant to use your brain and see something that deals with human drama basedon life choices.
