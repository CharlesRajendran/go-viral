A young priest Alex(Heath Ledger)goes to Rome along with his love interestMara(Shannyn Sossamon)to investigate the mysterious death of hismentor.First of all, this movie was quite boring and also there were so many plotholes and things unanswered. I was confused at the end and I had so manyquestions that the story always failed to answer.Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon who are usually good actors are weak inthis, just like the movie itself.However, I did like the music and the setting.I would give The Order 5/10.
