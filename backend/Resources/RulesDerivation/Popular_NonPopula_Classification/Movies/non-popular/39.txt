I can see how this movie might offend or bore people. The maincharacters aren't good or evil, they are complex. It's NOT an actionfilm nor is it about demon hunting. It more questions what is power,what is eternal, and who decides what's best for people.*May contain mild spoilers* I was reluctant to see The Order because Ihate horror and didn't want to see another Excorcist knock off, butthis movie was everything I could have hoped for in a creative andintelligent film. The Order suffers from the same poor marketing thatwas given to The Village. Both were portrayed ashorror/suspense/monster films when they were actually more like parableor mystery. I'm amazed that this film even got made considering thetrend towards films to do anything to shock, scare and shake youremotions these days. This film is more for shaking your mind.I'm shocked that the film got such low ratings. I guess people are moreinterested in mindless entertainment. What I got out of the film wasvery deep. It questions if the Catholic church is the only way towardssalvation. The main character is a Priest who's part of a renegadeorder. It's like a coming of age story in a lot of ways and questionshow much control a person has towards the direction his life takes.Anyone who complains that some parts were predictable must not havebeen paying attention to the film. One of the points was the priestslife being set up like dominos to fall in a certain order (no punintended). Even with the predictability, there are surprise twists andquestions of freewill. The main characters are more symbolic of apersons psychological make-up if anything. It's a very complex film andkept my attention. It's not for people with ADHD.
