This review may sound abstract, but in an effort to preserve the surprisesand events of the film, I was only left with my own feelings on it.Hopefully it will help to persuade everyone to see this wonderful work ofart.I just came back from the theater after seeing this film with friends.Onesaid it was the best film she had seen all year, and the other said shewasvery confused, while I was unable to form a concrete thought.  I justwantedto sit in a quiet room and reflect.  I was finally able to come to theconclusion that I need to see the film again.  It was extremely intenseandalmost disturbing look at a subject that has always puzzled me:Religion.I now want to sit down and have a critical discussion of the film and allofthe issues it addressed.  I love this type of film, and would recommend itto anyone who enjoys thinking during and after films, and who likes uniquestory writing and fresh looks at controversial issues.Besides the great writing and overall effect of the film emotionally andintellectually, the characters and actors can not be ignored.  A huge fanofHeath Ledger going into the theater, I came out with a deeper appreciationof his talent.  The conviction of the entire cast brought the whole filmtogether, making what could have been a ridiculous collection ofcharactersand events into a convincing piece of high quality art and storytelling.
