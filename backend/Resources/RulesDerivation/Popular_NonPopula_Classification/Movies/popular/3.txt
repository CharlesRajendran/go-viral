This western is very unusual in that it features three top leadingmen--Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum and Richard Widmark. Now you'd thinkwith all this high-octane masculinity and acting that this would be aterrific film, well, you'd be wrong. While it isn't a bad film, it doessuffer from a thoroughly adequate script--one that never seems todeliver the goods.Douglas plays an ex-senator bent on starting the first white colony inOregon in 1848. The problem is that he's not exactly 'Mr.Personality'--and his abrasive and autocratic ways rub everyone in thewagon train wrong. Can he get them all to his promised land or will thefolks ditch him and make for California? Tune in and see.For the most part, this is a pretty ordinary drama about settling theWest. As for Douglas, he overacts more than usual (and what's with thatwhipping scene?!?!). Widmark's character is inconsistent andunderwritten. The only lead who comes off well is Mitchum--as a wearyKit Carson-type. Aside from being pretty ordinary and predictable, thefilm did have a few pluses. There was nice cinematography and as ahistory teacher, I appreciated how they showed lots of mules, oxen andcows pulling the wagons--whereas most films only show horses (amistake). But this isn't enough to raise it above mediocrity.
