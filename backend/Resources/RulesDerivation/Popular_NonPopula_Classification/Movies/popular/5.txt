I watched the series "Victory at Sea" when it was first aired in 1952and 1953. My dad had me sit with him to watch the documentary weekafter week. I loved it! Even when my brother was born 10 January 1953.The doctor said my mom would be in labor quite a while, but dad saidshe would have the baby and he would be home to watch Victory at Sea.He was!I viewed this several times over the years on PBS, and eventuallypurchased the VHS copies. I cannot watch this without recalling my dadtelling me the places shown where he was stationed, and the events hewitnessed. I totally associate this set with my father.Now I have the DVD set, and just watched it again between Vet\'s day andmy father\'s 85th birthday in 2005. I miss him all the more since hispassing in 2002 watching this set. I LOVE the music!While my dad toldme about the war my mom told me about the music. Much of the music isfrom musicals composed by Richard Rodgers in collaboration with hart.The music for all planes flying is in F sharp, and many other specifickey usages. You really need a musical ear to fully appreciate Victoryat Sea!!!!Watching this series is overwhelming to say the least. I once watchedthe first eight episodes in one day straight through. THat was hard totake, but I sure appreciated this being recorded!Terry Klasek Saint Louis, Missouri
