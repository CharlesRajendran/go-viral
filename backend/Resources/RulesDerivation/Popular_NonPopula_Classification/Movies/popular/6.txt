There isn't much to say about this fondly remembered series that hasn'talready been said. This World War II documentary is just about as goodas it gets. The writing, the music, the editing, the narration (whichtends to get a bit pompous at times, but it's a small price to pay) areabsolutely superb. Watching this is actually sort of a chillingexperience; after awhile you begin to feel as if you've beentransported on board the ships, or in the subs, or at Pearl Harbor, oron Iwo Jima--not just sitting in your living room watching it on TV.This series deserved every award it won, and more. It is a magnificentachievement, and nothing has equalled it since. Don't miss it.
