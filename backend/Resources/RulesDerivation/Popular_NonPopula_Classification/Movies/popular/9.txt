Victory At Sea is a great television series about World War 2 producedby NBC in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. Most of the footage was shotby Navy cameramen. NBC edited the footage, added a host and the musicalscore by Richard Rogers. That was reality TV in the early days oftelevision production. While this a comprehensive and educationalseries and should be watched, viewers should be aware the versionreleased by A&E on DVD is substandard as the sound level constantlyfluctuates. The version released by Studio 1 has much better sound butthe episodes are abridged and the distributor does not warn consumers.But, for the price buy the Studio 1 release. It is much more satisfyingthan the A&E version. Buyer beware.
