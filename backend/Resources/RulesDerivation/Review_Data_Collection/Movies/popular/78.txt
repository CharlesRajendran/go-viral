Surviving a plane crash and then going on to meet the families of thosewho did not. What an intriguing idea! How morbid, to say the least; butyet this is a well-done film mostly because of a fine ensemble cast.Shelley Winters is one of the passengers who did not make it. Followinga difficult life and breakup, she is one of the passengers whointeracted with the survivor.What do you say to the families at a time like this? How does one feel?Why did they survive the crash and the others did not? We face seriousquestions of ethics and moral values in this film.Surprisingly, Bette Davis took a supporting role in this film. She isquite effective as the bedridden wife of one of the victims. No matterhow large or small the part, Miss Davis always could figure it out!
