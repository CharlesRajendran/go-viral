Fact 1:Claude Autant-Lara's mother was a pacifist activist.She was athespian of la Comedy Française and she was fired because of heropinions in WW1.She was even jailed.When it was released,"le Diable au Corps" caused a scandal;well-meaningpeople were saying that the Army ,the Red Cross,the soldiers and theirwives were dragged through the mud.Autant Lara was a rebel at thetime:conformism was not his way ,as such works as "Douce" had alreadyshown.Raymond Radiguet's novel was tailor made for him.Gerard Philipe was too old for the part:he was supposed to be 17,and hewas actually born the same year as his co-star Micheline Presles!That'swhy such lines as "When you're young,I'll be old" cannot be taken tooseriously by those who know the two French actors.But anyway Philippe'syouthful looks can delude people quite well.The film is a long flashback,with a prologue ,a scene in the middle ofthe film and an epilogue in the present.François attends her lover'sfuneral .Autant-Lara ,who was first a film editor ,makes the best ofthe sound effects and the fuzziness of the pictures when he introducesthe three long flashbacks.This woman was married to a soldier gone towar.Lines have warned us before the cast and credits;in brief,this is parexcellence a romantic movie;some scenes are quite remarkable: -The lovers in front of the fireplace,then boating on the lake wherethey are not sheltered from the outside world .-The landing-stage ,which plays a prominent part in the story:when sheleaves,it may be the last goodbye;the night they pretend they did notcome to the rendezvous (and they both did).- Marthe's coffin taken out of the church,when the crowd cries out ofjoy ,rejoices and applauds.Is it to celebrate the Armistice or to theadulteress 'death."Now,it's women's turn to die" a man yells.FACT2: in the late fifties ,A.L.,who had not yet lost his bite,plannedto make a movie about a burning subject:the contentious objector "Tu netueras Point".Gerard Philippe had agreed to play the lead,but he diedbefore the movie could begin to be filmed (the censorship was harsh inthe Algeria War years)and was replaced by Laurent Terzieff.As an user points out,"Le Diable Au Corps" seems to have vanished intothin air.It has not been screened for years (more than 20 years).Is itbecause of the remake?Or like "Tu ne Tueras Point" which was neverbroadcast,is the subject still too scandalous? FACT 3:A.L could never get over the Nouvelle Vague's (andothers)attacks and if my memory serves me well,he gave some of hisworks to the Swiss government -"cause there(France) they ignore me,theydespise me"-As an user wrote,he did support the far right wing circa1980 till his death.(in spite of such works as "Le Franciscain deBourges" (1967) an extraordinary performance by Hardy Kruger playing aNazi priest,a saint in a living hell)
