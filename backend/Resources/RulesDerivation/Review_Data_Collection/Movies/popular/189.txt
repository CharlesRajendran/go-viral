Who can forget these two cavalier Mexican heroes, The Cisco Kid, playedby the dashingly handsome Duncan Renaldo and Pancho, his loyalsidekick, played wonderfully by Leo Carillo. When I was a boy, the"Cisco Kid" was a weekly series and I never missed it. Both of theseactors are long buried and mostly forgotten. The message they deliveredto their young audiences each week was the same message delivered by somany other oater serials of the day; always stand up for the rights ofthe underdog. If your friends and neighbors need help, it's up to youand other good people to come to their assistance. After all, it's thehonorable thing to do. Although Renaldo and Carillo faded into relativeobscurity in the years following their T.V. series, I'm sure they wentto their final rewards feeling a large measure of satisfaction for thepositive affect that their little t.v. program had on the lives of somany youngsters during their formative years.
