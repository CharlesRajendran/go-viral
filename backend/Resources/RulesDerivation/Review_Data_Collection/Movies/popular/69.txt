This is a great film. Not in the same sense that Bridge on the River Kwai,or 2001. This film delivers a great message in a very palatable form withonly the last minute or two being a little over the top.Betty Davis had only a small part in this film, but what a part hercharacter was the most flawed and learned the most, the hard way.
