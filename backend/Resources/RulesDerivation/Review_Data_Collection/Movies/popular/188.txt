Fell in love with the show when I was four years old, and never stoppedloving it. I always felt that Cisco and Pancho were the idealmen--caring, brave, and gallant, protecting defenseless victims,sending their rewards to mission orphans, etc.The early shows mentioned O. Henry, as in "O. Henry\'s Cisco Kid"--Ihave always wanted to know the name of the book or short story thatcontained the Cisco Kid. The story is not in any of my O. Henrycollections, so maybe it went out of print. Also, it would be nice toknow who wrote the lovely theme music, and if it\'s currently available.The show was also notable, to me, for not using women characters onlyas victims--often, women were just as devious, villainous, and able asthe men with whom they were associated.
