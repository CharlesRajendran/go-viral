This eye-popping, special-effects-laden Asian fantasy is a real feast forthe eyes. It stars Yuen Biao as a soldier who, fed up with the constant andseemingly pointless civil war, deserts his platoon only to find himselfcaught in another battle. He escapes the battle by falling off a cliff, butdescends unharmed into a cave, where he is rescued from an attack byglow-eyed flying demons by a fantastic warrior with a magical flying sword.He goes under the tutelage of the warrior, who is reluctant to take on a newpupil. What follows, words cannot aptly describe. Suffice it to say, it\'s anabsolutely frenzied mix of action, special effects and bizarre, magicaloccurrences. The action is non-stop and the editing is laser-paced. I wasabsolutely exhausted by the end of the film. The cast is likewisefirst-rate. I was impressed especially by Sammo Hung in a dual role: as YuenBiao\'s soldier buddy, and as Long Brows, the ancient priest who holds theBlood Monster at bay using his "sky mirror" and magical extending beard andeyebrows...You\'d have to see it to understand. Suffice to say that there\'smany moments in this film that will have you thinking, "I have no ideawhat\'s going on, but it sure *looks* cool." Trust me, you won\'t be able totear your eyes from the screen.
