O.K., so this is not a critical classic. In fact, it\'s oddball, low-budgetnonsense. But you have to admit, it\'s great fun to watch. It\'s so strangethat it forces you to watch it to the very end, just so you can be sure youare not making an error about the preposterous plot you\'re seeing. It\'scampy madness and I\'de recommend it to anyone interested in the obscure.Youwill find yourself wondering: How did they ever get Raymond Burr to takesuch a role?
