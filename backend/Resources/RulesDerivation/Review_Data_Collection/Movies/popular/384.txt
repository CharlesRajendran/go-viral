Weary of railing against Warner Brothers for the studio\'s mishandlingof him, James Cagney moves to small Grand National, which produces forthe star this sprightly musical compote. Cagney brings along all of hisvigor and verve, and the little-known studio supplies a substantialbudget for this tale of a Manhattan hoofer and bandleader, Terry Rooney(Cagney), and his sweetheart/wife (Evelyn Daw), who journey toHollywood when Rooney is offered a film contract. Down-to-earth Rooneyis resistant to receiving the prescribed "star treatment" and the headof the studio, Mr. Regan, (Gene Lockhart) construes his attitude ashauteur; when the initial film made with Rooney unexpectedly becomeswildly successful, the studio boss tries to keep the compass of histriumph from the budding star to prevent the latter from becoming morearrogant. Meantime, Rooney places his film experiences behind him bytaking his bride on a lengthy cruise in a tramp steamer to the SouthSeas, and when they return and discover his exploding fame, comediccomplications ensue. Cagney displays his customary class in his everyscene with the musical production numbers being particularly effective,his dancing skill being a prominent element. True soprano Evelyn Dawperforms beautifully throughout, and the classically trained singermakes for a comely female lead as well, while William Frawley as apress agent, Mona Barrie as the studio diva, and Philip Ahn, who playsRooney\'s houseboy, all provide enjoyable turns. Director VictorSchertzinger utilizes his own Academy Award nominated score to aliberal extent throughout and the product becomes a tuneful and ratherundervalued musical comedy.
