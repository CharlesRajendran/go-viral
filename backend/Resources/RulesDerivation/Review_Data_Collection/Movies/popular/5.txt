"Double Wedding" is an enjoyable, albeit dizzying comedy starringWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy. It\'s really a tribute to the cast thatthey were able to carry on in such a wacky movie despite being shutdown for a time due to Jean Harlow\'s untimely death. Both Powell, whowas involved with Harlow, and Loy, who was a friend of hers, took herdeath very hard.Powell and Loy play polar opposites in this film. She is a completecontrol freak who has her life, her sister\'s life, and the life of hersister\'s fianc√©, planned down to the millisecond. Along comes Powell,who lives in a trailer and hocks items when he needs money. Once he\'sin their lives, all bets are off, and chaos reigns supreme.The cast is great but the whole thing kind of veers off focus from timeto time. The writing isn\'t as strong as in some of the other screwballcomedies of the era. But Powell is a treasure and teamed with Loy, evenmore so.
