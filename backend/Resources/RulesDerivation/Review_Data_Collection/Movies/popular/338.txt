This was on BBC television, dubbed into English, in the early sixties.No other film has had quite the same effect. I remember begging myfather not to start watching the film as it was already 10.15 p.m. andwe had to get up the next day for school and work respectively. In theend we were totally captivated by the harrowing story of a young man(GÃ©rard Philipe) who causes the death, through adultery, of the wife ofa serving WW1 soldier.Particularly memorable is the use of flashbacks, introduced by theeerie sound of church bells winding down, as one might slow down agramophone record, and the historical background, including a scene ofpremature celebration of the end of the war.It is sad that the director, Claude Autant-Lara, turned out to be theFrench equivalent of a Nazi, and you wonder if that fact has led to avirtual embargo on the film, and that is why it seems to havedisappeared. That is a pity. If that criterion were applied to works ofart in general then a number of books or pieces of music, or whatever,would be banned because of the activities or opinions of theircreators. 'Devil in the Flesh' is a shattering masterpiece, anddeserves to be seen again. It is my favourite film of all time.
