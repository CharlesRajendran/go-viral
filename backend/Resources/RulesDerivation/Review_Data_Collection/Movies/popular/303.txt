No Sad Songs For Me expresses what Margaret Sullavan wishes when shelearns she has terminal cancer. She thinks she's pregnant, but that'sthe verdict from her doctor John McIntire. Her problem is now how bestto arrange her life's final months.She'll be leaving behind husband Wendell Corey and daughter NatalieWood. And Sullavan has an interesting problem on her hands in theperson of Viveca Lindfors, a new employee for her surveyor husband.There's a growing attraction between them and normally that would callfor claws to come out. But Sullavan is thinking of Wood as well andface it Lindfors is a nice person who's not doing anything to encourageCorey. As for Wendell he's behaving like a perfect gentleman, but the signsare there. This is a fine and literate adult drama about a woman facing terminalillness and looking to make the best of it for herself and her family.Sullavan who mostly played tragic roles on screen gives her farewellbig screen performance in No Sad Songs For Me. She did do televisionand stage work until her suicide in 1960.In fact all the members of that screen family ended badly. Natalie Wooddrowned way too young and Wendell Corey became a misanthropic alcoholicwho died too young of liver cancer. Read Kirk Douglas's memoir TheRagman's Son to find out about how Corey's career turned bad.But in this film all the players give strong performances and the filmnever turns maudlin. That final shot with Lindfors and Wood withSullavan's shadow looming over them is unforgettable.
