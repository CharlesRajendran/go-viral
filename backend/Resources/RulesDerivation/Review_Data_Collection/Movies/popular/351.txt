Of course,the story was not very interesting - or,in otherwords,forgettable.Also,many of the gags weren\'t really funny.But all that doesn\'t count for it is Esther Williams\' first starringfeature- and she is so lovely and wonderful in the aquatic scenes,where she showsall her talents!The aquatic scenes are also well choreographed,the music for them is wellchosen,the side-scene as colorful and kitschy as fabulous and the showfurious and excellent!I also liked the appearances of the music stars...all in all,a typical Hollywood musical classic!
