What a Great Film with an outstanding cast, Bette Davis and Husband G.Merrill shine in this drama. Merrill visits three families with a messagefrom the dead. Each story has its own lesson and yet all are about love.Thestory about  Davis and her husband  in the film tells what love reallymeansnot what today\'s X-rated world thinks it is. This film should be shownmoreoften. Come on AMC
