The comedy here is supplied by Hugh Herbert, Edward Brophy, Allen Jenkins,Fritz Feld, Curt Bois and a sextet called the Schnickelfritz Band.  I nevercould fully understand the appeal of Hugh Herbert, or any of the comedianswho use stupidity for laughs.  (Marie Wilson and Gomer Pyle come to mind.)Here, Herbert gets a wire telling him he\'s hired the wrong group to come toParis for a dance exposition and is about to call out the riot squad whenthe bogus pair he hired convinces him, through a talking dog (viaventriloquism by Mabel Todd) that they are the right group.  Now, some maythink that\'s funny, but I prefer the savviness of Brophy, who always knowswhat\'s going on and whose comedy comes from his reactions and situationshe\'s placed in.  Here, he\'s a gangster patron of ballet, who cries at itsbeauty but has no hesitation in eliminating the enemies of his friends.He\'s dispatched to do just that in Paris and befriends Allen Jenkins,unaware that Jenkins the one he\'s looking for.  Now that\'s funny.  Brophyalso has the face and demeanor which makes me laugh just by looking at him,a reaction I also get with Woody Allen.  Bridging the musical and comedyaspects of this film is the Schnickelfritz band, a precursor of Spike Jones,doing some funny numbers while in funny positions. There\'s even a washboardin their musical instrument collection. Busby Berkeley creates and directsall the numbers in the movie. Although it\'s not his best work, it is mostlydue to his constant battle with Warner Bros. to get bigger budgets for hisnumbers, something of which he complained about often.  Still, they\'re funto watch.  A giant Navy hat engulfs the two dozen gorgeous chorus girls inwhat is the most spectacular musical sequence in the movie.  "I Wanna GoBack to Bali" number was also extensively staged and equally as good.  RudyVallee was top-billed and sings four of the songs in the movie and RosemaryLane was the love interest, singing a couple of songs too. The plot isroutine, with an on-again, off-again romance and a suspenseful ending whichhas the group about to be deported before they even perform in thecontest.
