Well, I've always sort of identified myself as an AngloBanglo.My dad was born in Lahore in 1929 and my grandparents left Karachi in1965 almost 20 years after partition because the Muslims had made itimpossible for my Nana to continue to run her private school.The returned to England like so many AngloBanglos where they were tooIndian for the white and not Indian enough for the Indians.Just like they were back in what was then Pakistan and by some account,India itself.You have to remember that at this point, as depicted in the film, 1947was the cusp of partition and violence was everywhere. My grandfathertold me graphic stories of entire trains of people slaughtered he hadwitnessed.Ava Gardner's character has to choose which side she is on but for manyAngloBanglos the struggle goes on. We are neither brown enough for thebrowns, nor white enough for the whites. I now live in Canada but Iself identify as English.The sub text in George Cukor's story has lost some of it's impact overtime because few remember the upheaval of partition but for some of us,it bring it back into focus.More interesting to me is that it was released the year I was born, inEngland, in 1956.
