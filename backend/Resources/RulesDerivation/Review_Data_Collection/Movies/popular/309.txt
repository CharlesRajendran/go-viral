I saw this film at a screening several years ago at the Edinburgh FilmFestival.  The picture was actually introduced by Mr.Ulmer\'s daughter.It\'sa typical 1940\'s melodrama that is well directed.  It is apparent inviewingthe film that Ulmer knew exactly what he was doing when he made a movie.Itwas only the second Ulmer film I had seen, the first being the superiorDetour.  I can\'t remember the plot in too much detail because it was awhileago, but it involves an illegitimate child.  It has a good social messageinthat it sheds light on how so-called "bastard" children are sometimes thesubjects of social discrimination.  I\'m surprised it hasn\'t received morevotes.  I guess I was lucky to catch that screening.
