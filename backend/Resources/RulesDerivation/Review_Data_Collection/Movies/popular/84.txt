Fairly interesting story of stranded passengers on an airlinerrecalling incidents from their past as they await connection to anotherplane. Nicely directed by Jean Negulesco, it's only problem is theuneven pace of the stories which are blended together rather smoothly.Foremost among the passengers are MICHAEL RENNIE, GARY MERRILL, SHELLEYWINTERS and KEENYN WYNN (in one of his most obnoxious roles). Rennierecalls his unhappy marriage involving an auto accident he wasresponsible for while drinking--in which he lied about not having beenbehind the wheel. Wynn is a clownish fool who shows everyone a photo ofhis attractive wife in a bathing suit pose (BETTE DAVIS, whose laterappearance in the film is after an accident has made her a cripple).Merrill is a seasoned traveler who calms the frazzled nerves ofstripper Winters when the plane goes through storm turbulence. Shelley gives her usual breezy and brash performance; Merrill islow-key and charming as a lawyer who doesn't drink too much; and Rennieis interesting in a key role. The story gains interest after the plane crash when Merrill takes itupon himself to visit the victims' families, the most poignant part ofthe story involving his confrontation with BETTE DAVIS who is no longerthe image of the glamor photo Wynn showed to the other passengers.Told in typical '40s style with flashbacks serving as backgroundfiller, it holds the interest thanks to the excellent performances of afine cast. BETTE DAVIS makes the most of small but interestingcharacter role and BEATRICE STRAIGHT is touching as Michael Rennie'sloyal wife. The EVELYN VARDEN/CRAIG STEVENS flashback with Vardenpainting herself as a saintly mother-in-law of Shelley Winters is ahowl. Major fault: the story seems too contrived and Merrill's motivationsfor seeing and getting involved with the families is a bit hard toswallow.
