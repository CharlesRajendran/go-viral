The new version released by Image Entertainment is simply the best you\'regoing to get on this film. The image quality is excellent, a few lines &scratches here and there, but much, much better than the old worn and editedprints that have been circulating for who knows how long. The first sceneyou see is newly restored, giving a look at Gladys and Malone and why shewon\'t marry him (in the old version we never saw this, instead it startedout at the London Record Journal office). And there is so much more,expanding on scenes, scenes I had no idea about, and the soundtrack by theAlloy Orchestra is superb. A truly great experience, finally an acceptableversion.
