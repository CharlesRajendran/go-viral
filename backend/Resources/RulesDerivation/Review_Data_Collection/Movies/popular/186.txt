I used to have a television that occasionally got a weak signal stationfrom Fort Erie, Ontario over here in Buffalo. And I got to relive alittle childhood seeing episodes of Cisco Kid and the Lone Ranger.Unlike the Ranger all of Cisco's stuff was in color. Great foresightbecause a whole lot of westerns that were done in black and white can'tbe given away now.Cisco was quite the guy. A gentleman always, a righter of wrongs, andan amazingly tolerant guy to keep Pancho around. Unlike Tonto who wasreally useful to the Lone Ranger, I think Cisco kept Pancho around forlaughs. He was slow on the uptake, but devoted to Cisco, and someoneyou didn't have to worry about betraying you.I thought and still Cisco was great. Many friends in my age group andslightly older who are of Latino background told me how much Ciscomeant to them as a role model. He was such a good guy, I wonder what hedid that made him an outlaw in the first place.O Henry spent much time in border towns on the American side and in oldMexico himself. In writing The Caballero's Way and introducing us toCisco, he gave us another universal hero. Cisco will be syndication 100years from now.Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo were a couple of Hollywood veteranswith substantial credits. But they will always be known as the CiscoKid and Pancho.By the way, did Pancho have a last name?
