Cacoyannis, best know for directing the film Zorba the Greek (akaAlexis Zorbas) in 1964, explored some of its themes in this 1956 film,which stars Ellie Lambeti. She plays a young woman who is constantlyharassed by the young bachelors who live on the island of Hydra becauseshe refuses to marry any of them. When a worldly Athenian comes by andrents a room in her home, the rumors begin to fly. In The Girl in Blackand A Matter of Dignity (and even Zorba the Greek), Cacoyannisdemonstrates a perfect and natural ability to explore moral issueswithin the culture, as well as create believable and moving tragedy.The earlier films came straight from his imagination (Zorba was adaptedfrom a novel), and they are the works of a great screenwriter, one ofthe best of the era. Cacoyannis\' direction in these two films is alsoflawless. He did really well in Zorba, too. One wonders why hisabilities aren\'t more highly considered. I would guess it is becausethese early films are fairly obscure nowadays. I guess he\'s an artistwho deserves to be rediscovered.
