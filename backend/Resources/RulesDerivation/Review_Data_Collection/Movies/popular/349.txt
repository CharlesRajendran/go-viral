The lack of plot is part of what is fun.Released during the middle of WWII, it is a rather obvious excuse toshow beautiful women in bathing suits and have lots of really goodmusical numbers. There are several wonderful location shots, even though most of it wasfilmed on a sound stage. One of the locations look likes it was filmedin Palm Springs.Red Skelton is adorable if a bit typecast. Ester Williams is stunninglybeautiful and graceful.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable, if silly, movie. A great movie forfamily viewing especially with younger children.
