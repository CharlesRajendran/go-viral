From the first few frames, as the title credits wash in and out like thetide, this is a superb film, full of fog, shadows, suspense, and greatperformances from Cregar (brilliant in this), Oberon, Hardwicke and others. It manages to be chilling and moving at the same time, and the ending seemsincredibly sad and poetic after what has gone before.  This makes it all themore memorable.  Sadly not on video at the moment unless you dig around, butdeserves to be better known than perhaps it is.  In comparison with thesilent version by Hitchcock, this is more deranged and evil than Novello\'scuckoo clocks and wild eyes, and also has a more logical conclusion that theviewer was sure of from early on.  The strongest scene is the one inOberon\'s dressing room quite near the end, which gives the viewer as much ofa fright as it gives her.  After that it is somehow reminiscent of Phantomof the Opera, not without advantage.  Well worth a look.
