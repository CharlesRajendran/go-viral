Joan Crawford is in her element here!  As a deceitful, manipulative womanwith the Medusa touch she\'s in her glory.  You get the feeling she\'senjoying herself immensely.  Hell, you even get the feeling she\'s enjoyingthe costumes!  She tears into the part of Eva Phillips as if it were herlast meal, and takes the rest of the cast along for the ride.  They don\'tmake movies like this anymore and it\'s a shame.  It\'s good, clean, sinisterfun with Joan in control every step of the way.
