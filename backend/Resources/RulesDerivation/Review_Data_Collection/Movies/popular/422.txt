With sympathetic main characters and an approach that is usually understatedenough to avoid over-sentimentality, this bittersweet story works reasonablywell most of the time.  Irene Dunne plays this kind of role well, handling awide range of material while keeping her emotions and reactions restrainedenough to be believable.  Cary Grant is better than one might expect him tobe in this kind of role.  It\'s possible that Edgar Buchanan\'s performancemight be the most important of all in holding it together, since he is idealin providing some down-to-earth balance, whether his character is repairingprinting presses or giving the young couple some tips on taking care oftheir baby.Director George Stevens does a good job with the pacing, and thestory-framing technique with the various songs works pretty well.  Whilethere may be a few moments when the sentimentality gets dangerously high,most of the time it remains balanced, and certainly more so than is the casewith present-day movies of this kind.  It\'s far from flawless, but it isgenerally effective in telling the kind of story that takes a combination ofsensitivity and restraint to tell believably.
