An elegiac look-back by the Maestro on where his films were shot(Cinecitta), Intervista has the most meta-fictional plot devicesFellini\'s used yet. --It features Fellini himself, shooting a film "recounting" a location(as in "Roma") but here he is more forefront. --The rather casualstream-of-consciousness meandering of the happenings hearkens to"Amarcord," which is similar to this, with a wistful look back on thepast, with fascists, bus rides, buxom women, etc. "Intervista" trulyseems like an alternate draft of "Amarcord" with Fellini personallyadded. --The "young Fellini" going on an interview, being shot byFellini during an interview in present day, and the playful andinsistent 3rd-wall being broken every so often.--And of course Marcello and Anita as themselves. For fans of Fellini, this is an absolute must-see. Its reflection onhis work, himself, and making films makes it one of the most playful,subversive, and autobiographical films in Fellini\'s late career.(Originally a t.v. production, it displays a smaller scale that canonly be attributed to the budget (too bad) and a need to make things"play" on a smaller screen. Although very similar to "A Director\'sNotebook", another filmic essay (that was a rough draft for "Roma"),this one is more assured and stands on its own. )
