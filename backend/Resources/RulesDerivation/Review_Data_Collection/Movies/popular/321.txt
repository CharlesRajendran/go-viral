Dostoevskian descent into hell, Dostoevskian comprehension of evil asinseparable from good and inseparably alloyed to suffering, thus deservingof mercy, no matter how brutal. The piling up of detail, the flow ofevents,is tight, relentless, funereal, and ominous, shot through half-smokedglassto lend it the surreality of a twilit underworld (compare to AlexanderSokurov\'s Mother and Son, 1997). With a minimum of strokes, the murdererisfully realized; his face alone is unforgettable; his flicking of coffeegrounds at the girls in the cafe window illustrates in one simple gesturehis murderous innocence. The killing itself is harrowing, hands-on ugly.Thenarrative is Spartan, matching its hardness to the tale. The only spuriousstep is the editorializing by the attorney against capital punishment; hewould have been more effective if more reserved in his passion andanguish.To its credit, there\'s no silly color coding, no overtly intellectualstructuralism. This is easily the most transparent, thus powerful,storytelling.
