Bela Lugosi steals the show of course, but, oddly the lovely Irene Ware(Miss America of 1929) gives the villainous Bela surprisingly vibrantopposition, considering this was one of her first films. The rest of theplayers (aside from merely adequate hero, Edmund Lowe) are likewisefirst-rate. One of my favorite comics, Herbert Mundin, has a wonderfullymeaty part, while gorgeous June Vlasek is just wonderful.The directors use an inventively roving camera to glide the audiencethroughmany a fabulously exotic set. The special effects rate as A-1.
