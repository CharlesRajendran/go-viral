Joan does her big eyebrow look again in this film about a true bitch inheat. Here she is an "outsider" who traps Barry Sullivan, scion of agood Southern family, into marriage and proceeds to make his life aliving hell. For that matter, she makes everyone who surrounds her atarget for her venom. She is truly a psychotic whose greatest thrill isto destroy everything and everyone within her circle of influence.She has a passion for her husband's friend, played by John Ireland whojust happens to be engaged to her husband's sister. After she ridesroughshod over those two with tragic results, she starts on her cousin,an innocent who is visiting this Garden of Eden. Probably a big mistakesince this leads to further trouble ending in a denouement that you cansee coming from a mile away. Very tidy.Is this a good film? Depends if you like Crawford at her histrionicbest, chewing up both the scenery and her co-stars. But again, asanother reviewer said, you will like this movie if you love Crawford orif you hate her. She's that good. It's one of those soap opera plotsthat were popular in the 50s and it will hold your interest, if only tosee if Joan gets her come-uppance. Don't be embarrassed if you findyourself liking this film......you're in good company.
