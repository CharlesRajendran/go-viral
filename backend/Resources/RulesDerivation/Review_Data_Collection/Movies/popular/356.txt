Here is a great idea: make a western with all the famous outlaws showing up:Jesse and Frank James, The Dalton brothers, Belle Starr and Sam Bass. Itmust have been financially rewarding because two years later "Return of theBadmen" came out with many of the same actors. Scott is a sheriff that endsup in a town full of outlaws looking for his brother who had been shot.There he falls in love with Ann Richards, who runs a newspaper. The real bad guy is Morgan Conway,who is supposed to be the one on the side of the law.Gabby Hayes gives a great performance as Coyote, quite different from hisusual sidekick roles. Fast paced and entertaining.
