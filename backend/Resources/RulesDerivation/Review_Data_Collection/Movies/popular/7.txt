In most people\'s head the animation film is connected to Disney movies ortoJapanese manga animation films, which are very hip nowadays. But everyoneseems to overlook Russian animators. The most influential of them is YuriNorstein, whose timeless masterpiece was awarded at the festival ofanimation films in Los Angeles in 1984 and at many other film festivalsthroughout the world. But why is this short half-an-hour movie sobeautiful?Firstly, because Norstein has a matchless visual style. I expectedsomethingspecial after I\'ve read about the film and before I saw it but what I gotissomething extraordinary: breathtaking pictures, fantastically clever useofmixed media, fine classical music.Secondly, because of the complex, symbol-ridden story, which is rooted inthe Russian mythology. The story is about childhood innocence, the loss ofthe loved ones and the duty of the artist. It\'s very European, veryEastern-European and because I\'m from Hungary and our past is verysimilar,this animation film is much closer to me than the American or Japaneseones.
