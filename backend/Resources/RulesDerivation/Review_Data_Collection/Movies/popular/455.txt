This is a fine movie adaptation of the classic story of "The Last ofthe Mohicans", for its time certainly, but in many respects it has heldup at least as well as just about any other screen version of thestory. The scenario emphasizes the gist of the story, develops most ofthe main characters efficiently, and at the right times creates a goodsense of danger and suspense.The story is by and large the one familiar from the novel, set in theSeven Years War (which in the USA is often called the \'French andIndian War\'), with the British and French relying heavily on theirallies among the various native tribes of North America. The Mohicanswere the tribe that had occupied some of the first land to be taken byEuropean colonists, and thus already in 1757 had almost disappeared. Inthe story, they are down to one father and one son, which addsconsiderable poignancy to events.The script in this version makes the interesting choice to deemphasizethe role of the Mohicans\' friend Hawkeye in the course of the story,instead portraying the two Indians, Uncas and Magua, as the primaryfigures in the fighting and in the ongoing battle of wits. Cooper\'snovel contains many lengthy descriptive passages, and they are omittedhere, replaced instead by many location shots that efficiently andeffectively suggest the atmosphere of the time, without using words.Albert Roscoe (as he was billed here) stars as the courageous MohicanUncas, Wallace Beery (always good in the role of a heavy) plays thetreacherous, mean-spirited Magua, and Barbara Bedford is Cora, whosesafety becomes one of the crucial issues in the conflict.While the story is largely the same, this has a much livelier pace thanthe novel, and it really works quite well. The photography is verygood, especially for 1920. It is well worth seeing for itself, and asan example of a good approach to adapting a classic novel into a movie.
