Another journey with Bob, Bing, and Dotty, this time the boys areescaping the law and a couple of shotgun wielding fathers in Bing'scase. They stowaway on a boat bound for Rio De Janeiro and they meetdamsel in distress Dotty with her "aunt" Gale Sondergaard and her twohenchmen Frank Faylen and Joseph Vitale. Dragon lady Gale has beenhypnotizing Dottie to force her into a marriage so that her inheritancecan be swindled.The Road pictures always had a usual pattern of songs. A ballad forCrosby, a ballad for Lamour, and some patter songs for Crosby and Hope.Crosby sings one of his nicest ballads with But Beautiful. Hope andCrosby do Appalachicola, Fla and Dottie does an unforgettable versionof Experience accompanied by Hope playing a bubble blowing trumpet.Bing Crosby's most frequent singing partners were the Andrews Sisterson record. They did enough material to fill more than three of thoseold fashioned vinyl LPs. But their only appearance in a movie with Bingis here and they sing You Don't Have To Know The Language with him asan extra treat.See it and figure out for yourself what was in those "papers" that theworld was better off in blissful ignorance of.
