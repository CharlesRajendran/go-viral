This is one of twelve filmings of the classic Fenimore Cooper novel, eighton film and two for television.  Having seen the 1936 and 1992 versions, Ican definitely say this 1920 version is heads above the other two.  What ismost amazing is the direction and the cinematography.  All of the actionsand the acting are restrained by 1920s standards, giving the film a realismit might otherwise have lacked.  There are over two dozen impeccablycomposed shots which give the film majesty and an overall beauty thatstuns.The narrative is true to the original book.  Very highly recommended forall lovers of film artistry.  A compelling experience.
