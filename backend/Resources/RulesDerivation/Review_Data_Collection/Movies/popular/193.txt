Curtiz\' slick, odd, interesting little flick.  Ann Dvorak is a small-towngo-getter.  Her boyfriend deserts her. She hooks up with a worthless,hustling traveling salesman and has a daughter by the boyfriend whodroppedher.  She tries to drop the salesman and gets involved in a murderimbroglio, but gets off with the help of fast-talking newspaper reporterLeeTracy. Fast paced and acted in Warner\'s best style
