I disagree with the first comment. I did not find this movie silly atall. I believe it was up to par with any other silent movie of thissame period, and the acting was not atrocious. I think it was a veryprovocative movie for its time and, whether it was purposefully or not,a great response to DW Griffith's "Birth of a Nation." That movieshowed a mulatto man trying to force himself on a White woman, alongwith numerous other stereotypes of Black people in that movie. "WithinOur Gates" showed the true side of what really happened, especiallywith the lynching, and the main character and her *real* father. I feelprivileged to have seen a Black silent film, especially one of suchhigh caliber.
