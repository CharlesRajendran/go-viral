Phone Call From A Stranger will be worth the watch for any Shelley Wintersor Bette Davis fans.  I watched the old, 1952 black and white movie on adrizzling afternoon and surprisingly, the flick made me feel real good.Why, you ask?  On back of the movie packet it tells you that "A plane crashputs an end to the sufferings of three ill-fated passengers ..."  With thatalone, one would assume that it\'s a totally \'down\' movie.  However, it isnot.  It\'s like that old saying that my grandmother used to make, "Ineveryone\'s life a little rain must fall".  Well, I guess she was right ifone is to enjoy the sunny days.  Which, Phone Call From A Stranger turns outto be:  a sunny day after much rain.This movie will make you feel good about yourself.  I promise.  I thinkthat\'s what so great about older movies;  no special effects to disturb thereal meaning of movies:  the actors and actresses.A must-see for classic movie fans.
