I haven\'t read the other user comments but whoever did the summary forthisfilm possibly hasn\'t seen it!  It has absolutely nothing to do with aserialkiller of women (the killer in question kills butchers because they killanimals) and Soper accuses his cousin Molyneux of having poisoned his(Molyneux\'s) wife.  The whole thing is an absurdist\'s delight -- a Frenchfilm set in a London that never was.
