Watching this movie was like looking through a beautiful, whimsicalkaleidoscope. So many facets are perfect: Loy at her peak of gorgeous,wry sophistication; the Deco sets; Powell's gentle irony; therelationships of various characters and the consistency of dialog; eventhe physical pranks were great--and I don't like slapstick all thatmuch! This film reminded me of Shop Around the Corner. It wasn't asgood, that's a tall order, but there was something bigger going on inthis movie than just the usual romantic farce. I have to admire thewriter's and director's ability to pull off a romantic comedy betweentwo such diametrically opposed people. The heroine is thequintessential control freak; the hero, as laid back and tolerant as ahippie of the sixties. No one apologizes for their quirks, which isrefreshing, and neither of them had to change all that much to make theending work. And as far as acting goes, Loy and Powell don't hold backany punches (literally!) whenever the two characters collide. It isamazing to watch them knowing how they were reacting to Harlow's deathduring shooting. I love finding old movies, and this one is buriedtreasure.
