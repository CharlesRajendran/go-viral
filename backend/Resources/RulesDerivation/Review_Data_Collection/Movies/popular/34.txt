So to sum it all up, Fellini seems to be saying in this film, he lived formovies.  Like a long train ride as a passenger, a lover, a player, acommentator he lived through it all and had his moments.  When MarcelloMastroianni says to Anita Eckberg while watching the fountain scene from LaDolce Vita with the party at her mansion that for one moment they mademagic, it seemed to sum it all up.   For the actors, the film maker and forus the audience, there were moments that were magic. This film is a greatmovie makers collage of his memories of his life.  If it had been cinematicitself it would have taken away from the message.  Life at its very bestcanyield a few magic moments, and those lucky enough to make those moments ofmagic can appreciate the rest of it all that serves as the backdrop.  Likethe film studio around which Fellini\'s life revolved and which gave him allthose great memories he shared with us here.
