Irene Dunne is a class act all the way. A real lady, and it comes outin this film. While she and Grant always look like movie stars in thefilm, you can\'t stop noticing that they look like movie stars, they dotheir job and do it to perfection. Only two A-level actors could carrythis tear jerker off well. The adoption lady was also realistic andconvincing. The little girl or baby, whichever children played them,were the cutest and sweetest I\'ve ever seen in film. Irene Dunne cannothit a false note, ever, it seems. She looks marvelous in everything shewears, be it a simple housedress or pajamas. Same with Cary Grant, hewears the clothes. The penny serenade theme and the way the cameraplays with the records is really magic. This film is a gift to theaudience. Grant and Dunne show their adeptness at establishing andmaking us believe they are an intimate married couple. Irene Dunne isat the height of sensitivity and softness here, a true lady withbeautiful hair and hairstyles. What a movie. And one cannot forget ourbeloved Apple Jack, such a sweet soul.
