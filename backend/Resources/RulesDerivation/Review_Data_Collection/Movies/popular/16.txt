If you are a fan of Hong Kong action films and you haven\'t seen this iwould suggest you track a copy down right now.As an opening paragraph it sums up the importance of this landmarktitle. Conceived by its\' makers as a production to rival Western filmsfor technical (behind the camera) as well as beating them technicallyin front as well.Although it fails to rival the level of sophistication with its\'effects (due to bane of all Hong Kong films, its\' limited budget)tomatch those of Hollywood films of its\' time is irrelevant, it looks andfeels so Far Eastern as well as using cutting edge (for 1982)it issimply unique.The story is set in mythical times in China, where constant warsthreaten to consume everyone, soldier or otherwise. One such soldier(ably played by Yuen Biao) manages to alienate himself from hiscommanders and ends up getting lost in the mystical region of Zu,fabled for its\' magic mountain.He becomes embroiled in a quest to find a pair of magical swords tokill a blood demon which threatens the whole of humanity. The blooddemon draws its\' power from pain and suffering and there is enough inthe world to allow it to destroy all mankind.The film contains so much energy, unparallelled visual flair and a castwhich has the skill and experience to make it all work. The directors\'vision and imagination are easy to see and appreciate, if you take thetime to look. It is too easy to watch the action and miss thesubtleties. It is a film which is difficult to describe, butunforgettable once watched.
