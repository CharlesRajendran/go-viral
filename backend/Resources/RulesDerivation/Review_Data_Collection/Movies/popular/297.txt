This is a great Victorian melodrama. Everything about this film is superb.The late Laird Cregar is just outstanding in the title role and MerleOberonhas never looked lovelier It\'s funny how you can see a film when you areabout twelve years oldand it sticks in your brain because it is so good and this one is one ofthebest. I highly recommend this film.
