The only print I've seen of this is pretty badly chopped up. Theydidn't make much of an effort to preserve these "b-movie" mysteriesback then.The film is directed in much the same manner as Browning directed theLugosi "Dracula" around the same time - slow, stagy, with emphasis onatmosphere, and with all the young women given over to hysterics.The film unnecessarily violates the Holmes canon when it shows us thebevy of young starlet secretaries Holmes has hired to aid in hisinvestigations (?!), But most of the story, and its characterizations,are faithful to the original story.The real surprise here is Raymond Massey - he is an absolutemagnificent Holmes, every bit as good as the great Jeremy Brett of theGranada TV series; and, given the stodginess of the rest of the film, Isuspect that he essentially directed himself - he moves quickly,easily, and directly, while the rest of the cast stands around waitingfor their cues.I can only recommend this to Holmes completists; but Massey'sperformance is not to be missed by anyone who admires the master sleuthof Baker Street.
