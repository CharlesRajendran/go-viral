This movie, which West had complete creative control over, is hermasterpiece.  While \'She Done Him Wrong\' is uneven and confusing \'I\'m noAngel\' is brilliant throughout.  West is all woman without a bit of cat ormouse, and there is delicious chemistry between West and Grant (althoughthis movie was made the same year as \'I\'m no Angel\', Grant looks older andhis acting is stronger).  And as much fun as it is to see masters at workin\'My Little Chickadee\' (and imagine West and Feilds writing together), thismovie outshines even that.  If you want to know what Mae West is all about,this is the film to see.
