When Mae West selected a young contract player from Paramount namedCary Grant as her leading man, a star was definitely born. But make nomistake about it, this film and She Done Him Wrong are her films and noone else'sIn I'm No Angel Mae spends the entire time of the film proving shedefinitely ain't. Every man in the film is completely captivated by herfree and easy sexuality. As this was pre-Code you have to listen hardto the dialog because Mae comes out with a gem every five minutes orso.Mae's a circus performer here and after her manager Edward Arnoldpersuades her to stick her head in a lion's mouth, her gate attractionincreases with her notoriety. Young millionaire Cary Grant is the lastof several in the film captivated by her. She's falling for him to, butArnold breaks it up for his own reasons.The end of the film is a breach of promise suit brought by Mae againstCary and when she takes over the cross examination of the witnesses theresults are a comedy milestone. Not that her lawyer, Gregory Ratoff,isn't capable enough, but he's rather distracted by her as well.Ratoff's performance in fact is the best one among the supporting cast.I'm No Angel is arguably Mae West's best film and I'm not one to argue.
