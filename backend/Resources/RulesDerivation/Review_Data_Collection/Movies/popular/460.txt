This film is unjustly neglected, though it's readily available on DVD.Other comments here give a good plot summary, so I'll just comment onthe film's strength's and weaknesses. The main weakness is that forwhat is basically a spy film, the suspense isn't very suspenseful -- itkept occurring to me how much better Hitchcock would have done it. Buton the positive side the film is otherwise well directed, with verygood acting (especially by Gracie Fields) vividly realizes theatmosphere of both Paris and the French countryside, and is beautifullyphotographed by Lee Garmes, one of the best Hollywood cinematographers.The ending turns surprisingly moving, and the score is one of thebetter ones of its time. I'd call it a film of broad interest whicheveryone will be glad to have seen once, especially if you appreciategood cinematography.
