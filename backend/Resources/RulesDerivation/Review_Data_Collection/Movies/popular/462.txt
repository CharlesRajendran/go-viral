Absolute grabber of a movie, and given its age, years ahead of itstime.I first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbor\'s TV, that theguy had thrown on the scrap heap. A tinkerer with all things electrical,dadhad it working inside two days. This was July 1955...and then probably onlythe third house in the street to HAVE television!  Pretty much the firstthing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old 12-inch screen was THISfilm.  "It\'s pretty OLD dear," I recall my mom telling me!Almost 50 years on, and it doesn\'t seem any older - rather like World War Iin that respect! Terrific little fantasy about a London omnibus carryingthirteen passengers, that crashes, killing one of their number. Then, inflashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them tobeing on this bus that very day.Returning to the crash at the end of the film, the victim\'s identity isrevealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie THE LIST OF ADRIANMESSENGER.If ever you come across this little gem, I suggest you watchit!
