  Maybe I\'m going out on a limb here, but having seen a great many of hermovies, I would say that Joan Crawford was at her bitchiest in this picture.That is to say, bitchier than usual! She tears at the scenery, she tears atthe script, and brother I feel sorry for her co-stars, because even thoughthey are also a talented group, they of course don\'t stand a chance whenCrawford\'s on the screen, which is basically every scene. Although hercharacter doesn\'t appear right away, it\'s still obvious from the very startthat this is a very, very Crawford movie. The film just instantaneouslygives off that omen. The gist of the story is this: Crawford is a glamoroussocialite who dominates her Southern family and takes great pride in doingso. Yes, we\'ve seen Crawford play this type of role before(HARRIETT CRAIG),but I personally never tire of seeing Crawford getting the upper hand.Though they didn\'t get along too well in real life, Joan Crawford and BetteDavis had much in common when it came to choice of movie scripts. They bothspecialized in playing catty, indomitable females, and they both clearlyrelished doing so. Crawford is at her best in this one. Sure, the scriptisn\'t the greatest she\'s been given, and frankly it\'s pretty sleazy stuff,but Crawford does wonders with it and manages to turn in her finestperformance. She clearly works at the part and isn\'t simply clawing andnailing at everyone around her. Even though her character is an absolutehorror of a human being, Crawford does her best to make her a sympatheticone, and she just about pulls it off! Some people will discard this one aspure camp, but this is a movie that serious Joan Crawford fans like myselfwill treasure, and no doubt watch over and over again.Terrific!!!!!
