I just love this sweet old movie.  Cary Grant is gorgeous, Irene Dunnebeautiful, Edgar Buchanan a lovable old codger. A story about falling inlove and the deep inner desire to build a family with the one you love --and the challenges and sadness that can be as great, but never reallygreater, than the happiness and fulfillment it brings.Falling in love, best friends, career challenges, pregnancy, miscarriage,infertility, adoption, death, divorce... it\'s all covered in this onesweetlittle movie.  And it\'s all told in a way that reminds us all howimportantmusic is as it sets the soundtrack to our lives.This is a wonderful movie.  It may not be Citizen Kane -- but it isdefinitely worthy of your time.
