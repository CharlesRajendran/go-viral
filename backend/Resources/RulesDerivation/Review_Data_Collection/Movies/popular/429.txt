One of the best films made. 1941 was a phenomenal year, not least forthis film and Grant\'s marvelous performance. Call it melodrama, butit\'s the stuff of life, heartbreak and love and helpless vulnerability.How unfashionable.I could watch Edgar Buchanan wash that baby a thousand times. Find meone actor with enough life experience today to do that scene. Just one.Independent films today often seem to strive to make the point thathuman drama is about the struggles and relationships of private life.We call it "sentiment" when studios made films about this sort of dramaand what\'s ultimately important on the most private level.
