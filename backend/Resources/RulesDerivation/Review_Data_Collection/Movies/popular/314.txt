Based upon the radio show of the same name this film is the story ofChandu,, real name Frank Chandler, a white man taught the secrets of theyogis. Chandler has been set loose to save his family who has been put intoperil by the evil Roxor, played by Bela Lugosi (who not long after wouldplay Chandu himself in a movie serial).Containing more action than most serials this is a true popcorn movie thatmoves pretty much from start to finish. There are dangers aplenty as Chandustruggles to save the world.The film is near perfect, but suffers from a couple of small flaws. Thefirst is the over use of the small man that Biggles sees each time hedrinks. Chandu enchants Biggles to prevent him from drinking and its used acouple of time too many. The second is that toward the end the effects lookweak. The underwater sequence is terrible, and the use of rear screen aspeople flee the temple is awful.Still this is a movie to sit down with a big bucket of popcorn andenjoy.9 out of 10.
