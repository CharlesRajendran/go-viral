Knowing that I enjoy watching some of the older movies, a friend at worklent me a VHS copy of `I\'m No Angel\'. It\'s not really something I would havepicked up on my own. I guess I had some preset ideas about Mae West movies.For some reason, unknown even to myself, this is the first time I everwatched an entire Mae West movie. What a pleasant surprise it was to find mypreconceived notions were totally wrong. Cary Grant and Mae West were greattogether. Very good acting all the way around and some interestingcharacters really helped to make this a very enjoyable viewing. This moviehad a bit of drama, lots of comedy, it was a bit of a musical, and had someromance. All of this was combined into a masterful blend to make this movievery entertaining. I was really surprised that the comedy was so effectivefor today\'s audience considering the movie was made 71 years ago. This was avery good movie that I recommend. Glad I watched it.
