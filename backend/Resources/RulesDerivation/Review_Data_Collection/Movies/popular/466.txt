Cheri-Bibi is the most celebrated magician & escape artist in France.Young & debonair, he enjoys the attentions of society & the love of oneyoung woman in particular. But when her wealthy father is foundmurdered & all evidence points to Bibi, he must put all hisconsiderable talents into evading the law long enough to clear his name- while being forced into living a life in the twilight & shadows asTHE PHANTOM OF Paris.According to cinematic legend, all the talkie MGM films starring JohnGilbert were dreadful - the result of a bitter hatred between Gilbert(the highest paid star in Hollywood, with a $1.5 million contract) &studio boss Louis B. Mayer. A determination on Gilbert\'s part tofulfill the contract, and a campaign instituted by Mayer to destroyGilbert\'s career - including spreading the rumor that Gilbert\'s voicewas \'high & feminine\', culminated in several unwatchable movies.Not entirely true. The Studio had a huge financial investment in JackGilbert and was not going to completely cut its own throat byshowcasing him in nothing but dreck. Of the 8 talkies in which heappeared as solo star (1929 - HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT; 1930 - REDEMPTION;WAY FOR A SAILOR; 1931 - GENTLEMAN\'S FATE; THE PHANTOM OF Paris; WESTOF Broadway; 1932 - DOWNSTAIRS; 1933 - FAST WORKERS) most werecertainly rather ghastly. THE PHANTOM OF Paris, however, was quitedecent, and, indeed, fully representative of the material the studiowas producing in 1931.Gilbert does a fine job through much of the film and has one standoutscene - hiding in a cellar - which is excellent and shows what he wasreally capable of. MGM gives him 3 top drawer co-stars (Lewis Stone,Jean Hersholt & marvelous old Sir C. Aubrey Smith) with which to work.The other featured players (Leila Hyams, Ian Keith & Natalie Moorhead)do creditable work. Movie mavens will spot Fletcher Norton in anunbilled role as a society twit.Ian Keith was undoubtedly cast as the villain due to his slightresemblance to Gilbert, which is important to the plot, although he isnoticeably taller. However, having Gilbert impersonate Keith and foolHyams, Moorhead or Stone for even a moment is ludicrous and the weakestpoint in the story.Finally, about The Voice. There was nothing at all strange orunnaturally high about Gilbert\'s voice. As a matter of fact, it was ofmedium range & rather cultured & refined. Which was the crux of theproblem, of course. While it is possible that no voice could have evermatched the perfect one viewers heard in their minds while watching hisstrong, virile silent roles, the reality was very different from whatthey wanted to hear (imagine Robert Montgomery\'s voice coming out ofClark Gable\'s mouth.) Gilbert was doomed from his first scene in hisdebut talkie; his war with Mayer only intensified the agony. He woulddie in 1936, forgotten by most of his former fans, at the age of only36.
