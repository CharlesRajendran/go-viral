Willian Cameron Menzies does a more than adequate job creating suspense inthis early serial-style thriller about a yogi mystic named Chandu protectingthe world, his sister and her family, and his Egyptian princess love fromthe evil megalomaniacal ways of Roxor.  Roxor has built a death ray to makehimself master of the world.  Only trouble is that the inventor will notgive him the secret of the ray and Chandu is on to his dastardly scheme. Edmund Lowe makes a dashing, affable hero with his ready wit and histheatrical gestures conjuring magic.  Roxor is played with aplomb by heavyBela Lugosi.  Lugosi steals all of his scenes and gives a first-rateperformance. Irene Ware as the Princess Nadja makes an attractive, brightleading lady, and the rest of the cast fares well too.  A thoroughly nicecomedic turn is performed by Herbert Mundin as Mr. Miggles.  He is a drunkenfriend/servant of Chandu and sees himself in miniature every time he takes adrink.  The film boasts what must have been relatively high productionvalues for the day.  It plays well considering it was made in 1932.  Thereare some great scenes in the film.  Menzies, best known for directingInvaders From Mars, uses a very fluid camera.  A scene where Chandu looksinto a crystal is most impressive as the camera zigs and zags through aEgyptian tomb.  Another memorable scene depicts the scientist\'s daughter,clad only in a tight slip, offered on the slave trading block.  The scenewas risque for its time to be sure.  While Chandu is certainly not a greatfilm, it is definitely a cut above many films made in its time.
