This is a superior film, but its impact is attenuated by the greatchanges in social attitudes toward sex and divorce which have occurredsince the time it was filmed. The conflicts and tensions in the storycould only occur today in third world nations or very religiouscommunities. Thus, most American viewers can wonder what all theexcitement is about.Diana Wynyard is a revelation. When the film began, she appeared a biton the plain side. However, she became enchantingly beautiful as themovie progressed. Her soft, pleasant, kind features and the exquisiteshape of her head and body impressed me more and more, as did her calmmanner and then her assertive testimony in court.She becameirresistible.Universal gave this a veneer of a prestige production. It looked likeit was shot in England, except that most of the English performers werealready old Hollywood hands. Jane Wyatt wisely didn't try for anEnglish accent. Whales' direction was seamless, but not as flashy ashis more famous horror productions. He kept things moving briskly.
