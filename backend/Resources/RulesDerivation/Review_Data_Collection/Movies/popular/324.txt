As an "old guy" with a nervous disposition who has enough troublesitting through many movies once, the ultimate tribute I can give thisgreat "on the road" rock\'n\'roll saga is that I watched it numeroustimes when it was on cable in 1981, I have watched it several dozens oftimes on VHS, and now that it\'s on DVD, I have watched it several timesagain. You can put a lot of mileage on this road movie. The film has arock\'n\'roll backdropÂ—a backdrop we rarely see from the workingman\'s eyethe way we do here. The movie gives us what amounts to real-world viewsof several 70\'s favorites (Meatloaf, Alice Cooper, Blondie, etc.). Ithas a great premise, the howling self-reliant "Everything Works If YouLet It" theme. It also enjoys a background soundtrack that fires on alltwelve cylinders. But what keeps me watching the film is that it isreally funny in an honest, straight-forward way that we have enjoyedfar too seldom since Hollywood started grinding out its cookie-cutterfarces in the wake of "Airplane." The dual surprises of the film arethe really solid performances put in by Alice Cooper and Meatloaf intheir respective roles as rock star and roadie. I am unqualified in myadmiration of this movie, but I will tightly qualify the people to whomI would suggest the film. This is a "cult" movie in the most real senseof the word and anyone who is made nervous by rock music, farce that isoutside of the "Scary Movie" mainstream, or three-hundred pound leadingmen (Meatloaf) should avoid this movie at all costs. Also, there is acertain good IL\' boy mentality at work here that will not play for someparts of the audience. But to the core audience of the film, these arenot qualifications, they are recommendations. The thing I am saddestabout is that the movie\'s soundtrack is no longer available. Thesoundtrack was worth having simply for the long and messy "Brainlock"which plays during one of the few really funny car chases in thehistory of film.
