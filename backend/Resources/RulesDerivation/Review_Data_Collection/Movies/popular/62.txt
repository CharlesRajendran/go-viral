The producers of "Mommie Dearest" clearly took copious notesfrom the real-life Crawford canon; traces of everything from"Mildred Pierce" to "Harriet Craig" to "Strait-Jacket" show up in thatbiopic-from-hell, but the film it most closely resembles is the 1955cult classic, "Queen Bee."Scenes of an imperious Crawford being served coffee in bed;destroying a bedroom with a riding crop (wire hanger?); and herchildren crying out in the dark are lifted directly from this movie;and Crawford\'s stunning appearances in various Jean Louisgowns--descending a grand staircase, posing in a doorway,preening in front of a mirror--are a harbinger of the dementedfashion show Faye Dunaway would put on in her Crawfordassasination.Like her rival, Bette Davis, Crawford is best-known for villanousroles like this, although neither she nor Davis often played bitches;but the times they did, the performances were so over-the-top, it\'swhat we remember them for. "Queen Bee" is the ultimatelate-period Crawford vehicle; she dominates every scene, evenwhen she doesn\'t directly appear in it, and her elegant bitchery is amarvel to behold. No one, but simply no one, could throw a furstole over her shoulder like Joan Crawford, and certainly no onecould top her as an obsessive-compulsive, castrating shrew.Crawford herself was happier playing heroines (like the "young"widow of "Female on the Beach," or the brilliant playwright in"Sudden Fear"), but she clearly was even more compelling infull-on bitch mode. As cruel, evil and thoughtless as her charactermay be, Crawford handles it with such glamour and panache, yousecretly find yourself rooting for her.
