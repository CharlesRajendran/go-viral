Easily one of the funniest comedies of the 193O\'s, this pre-code West-ernisa real treat. La West plays Tira, a carny gal who\'s been around the blockafew times: in order to raise some dough, she sticks her head into a lion\'smouth - and basks in the attention she receives from various fans. Thescenebetween Mae and Gertrude Michael is hilarious: "You haven\'t a shred ofdecency in you!" spouts the  snobbish Michaels to which Mae retorts "Idon\'tshow my good points to strangers!"  A young Cary Grant is one of Tira\'smanyadmirers and Edward Arnold is memorable as Tira\'s loud, gruff boss, BigBillBarton. Mae\'s courtroom plea, where she puts every man in his place - andwins the admiration of the judge is a gem. This film was made just afterMae\'s sensational hit SHE DONE HIM WRONG.  Feeling indebted to Westbecausethe film\'s success single-handedly saved Paramount Pictures from impendingbankruptcy, mogul Adolph Zukor promised Mae that she could do anything shewanted for her next film.  Because she had been fascinated by lions sincechildhood, she had her fantasy written into the movie\'splotline.
