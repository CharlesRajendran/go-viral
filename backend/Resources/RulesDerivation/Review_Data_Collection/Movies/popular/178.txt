One of the smartest, funniest, and exciting buddy pictures ever made.Ithas never received the wonderful attention it justly deserves. Theperformances by the two leads (De Niro and Grodin) are wonderful and theyget outstanding support from Joe Pantolino, Dennis Farina, and YaphetKotto.But what separates this picture from all the other action / comedies evermade is that the screenplay is so sharp and original. Easily my all timefavorite movie - you know how I know that? I must have seen "MidnightRun"at least thirty times and every time I see it, it gets better and better.Atrue film classic and is getting rereleased on DVD in June of 2003.
