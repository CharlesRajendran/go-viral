A man gets out of prison and gets back at his old partner by robbinghis racetrack. He even tells him he;'s going to do it and the owner isready for him. Yes, that's an improbable story but an intriguing one.It wound up with so many twists and turns in the final minutes that Icouldn't follow all of them. Many of the twists centered around ex-concharacter, which was impossible to figure out.Pierce Brosnan played "Neil Skinner," a man who served four years inprison he shouldn't have had to serve. Tom Skerritt plays "EbbetBerens," the racetrack owner whom Brosnan is after. Wendy Hughes plays"Sheila," the love interest in the film.Interesting overall as Brosnan seems to be tuning up for his suave,James Bond roles, which he would begin in about five years. This filmwas interesting, but unsatisfying by the time it was all over. Asimpler ending would have made this a much better film.
