BATHING BEAUTY offers lots of eye candy and a couple of hilarious REDSKELTON routines proving he\'s a master at physical comedy. The musicalinterludes are on the dull side and don\'t give strong enough material toEthel Smith (at the organ), Harry James, Xavier Cugat and Carlos Ramirez--aLatin tenor with a strong voice but no charisma.The slender plot is the usual misunderstanding that occurs in these type ofESTHER WILLIAMS movies. She thinks her newly wed hubby (Red) is the fatherof three boys, thanks to a practical joke played by BASIL RATHBONE (wholooks as if he\'d rather be elsewhere in a thankless role). She triesthroughout the film to get Red dismissed from the all girl college he entersjust to be near her. The highlight of the film is Red\'s bashful entranceinto a class of ballerinas, clad in pink tutu and ballet slippers--all thewhile being slapped around by a ruthless instructor and going through balletpaces with hilarious results.The supporting cast is largely wasted--including Bill Goodwin, MargaretDumont and Janis Paige in a brief role. Jean Porter gets to do more thanusual and even has a song and dance number with Red. The water ballet at the finale is nicely done in typical MGM manner but notas ostentatious as usual for an Esther Williams film. This was her debut asa leading lady and she has lots of confidence and poise, both in and out ofthe water. In fact, it\'s one of her better performances--but the spotlightbelongs to Red Skelton who deserves his top billing.
