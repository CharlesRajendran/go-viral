\tIt started out as a bit on Saturday Night Live, and grew into probably THEmost successful movie ever to have had it\'s genesis in that particularmedium.  And who would\'ve thought that a couple of character actor/comedianswould emerge from an innovative four-or-five minute act as `legendary\'bluesmen of their era?  Which is exactly what John Belushi and Dan Aykroyddid after first taking their show on the road as an opening act for thelikes of Steve Martin, and then parlaying it into a feature length motionpicture, `The Blues Brothers,\' directed by John Landis.  When Joliet JakeBlues (Belushi) is released from prison, his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) isthere to pick him up, in-- of all things-- a used police car.  And itdoesn\'t bode well for this particular pair of out-of-work musicians, who ona visit to the orphanage in which they grew up discover that it is about tobe shut down unless some taxes are paid on it, and soon.  But what can Jakeand Elwood do to help?  They\'re broke.  Well, after a bit of pondering and acouple of good production numbers later, Jake sees the light (literally),and it all becomes perfectly clear:  They have to put their band backtogether and stage a concert, the proceeds of which should more than pay forthe taxes on the orphanage.  It\'s a tough job, but somebody\'s got to do it,and don\'t tell Jake and Elwood it\'s not possible, because they\'re on amission from God...\tIt\'s a fairly simple plot, told in a straightforward manner by Landis, whocreates a visually stimulating and aurally satisfying movie that follows theadventures of the Brothers Blues as they travel around the good state ofIllinois, seeking out the members of their former band and formulating theirplan to save the orphanage.  Along the way they run afoul of acountry/western band, incite the ire of some Illinois Nazis, ingratiatethemselves to the diners in a classy restaurant, wreck an entire mall andgenerally wreak havoc wherever they go.  It\'s a total rush of excitement,backed with a blur of real blues, served up by some of the truly legendaryperformers of our time, like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, CabCalloway (doing his trademark `Minnie the Moocher\') and John Lee Hooker. Not to mention the `band\' itself, comprised of Steve `The Colonel\' Cropper,Donald `Duck\' Dunn, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Tom `Bones\' Malone, Lou `BlueLou\' Marini, Matt `Guitar\' Murphy and `Mr. Fabulous\' himself, Alan Rubin,all there to back the incomparable vocal stylings of Joliet Jake and ElwoodBlues, who are determined to save their old home, now under the auspices of`The Penguin,\' Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman).  But one questionremains to be answered:  Who is Camille Ztdetelik (Carrie Fisher), and justwhat is she trying to do to Jake?\tWithout question, this was a great gig for Belushi and Aykroyd, who tomillions of people ARE, and will forever be, the `Blues Brothers.\'  Andforevermore shall they be linked in the memories of anyone who has seen thismovie, heard their records or caught their act on SNL.  Dan Aykroyd has goneon to have a successful and varied career in movies, including an AcademyAward nomination for Best Supporting Actor (for `Driving Miss Daisy\' in1989), while John Belushi, of course, left us quite suddenly and way toosoon, just as his career was on the rise.  Were they great singers?  Ofcourse not; but they were accomplished performers who sagely surroundedthemselves with the best of the best, a `band\'s\' band that really made thisgig work, because the music worked.  Add to that the energy, excitement andpassion they themselves brought to it, and you have their formula forsuccess, which can be measured by the strong following they still enjoy tothis day.  And what a pity that Belushi isn\'t around to realizeit.\tMemorable in supporting roles are John Candy as Burton Mercer (who utteredthe unforgettable line, `Orange whip?  Orange whip?--); Henry Gibson as thesteel-eyed head Nazi; Steve Lawrence, as agent Maury Sline; Charles Napieras Tucker McElroy, `Lead singer and driver of the Winnebago\'; and JeffMorris, who will always be remembered as Bob, owner of `Bob\'s CountryBunker,\' the place with `both\' kinds of music, Country `and\' Western. \tThe additional supporting cast includes Steven Williams (Trooper Mount),Armand Cerami (Trooper Daniel), Layne Britton (The `Cheese Whiz\'), RalphFoody (Police Dispatcher) and John Landis (Trooper La Fong).  Also, watchfor cameos by Paul Reubens (Waiter), Frank Oz (Corrections Officer), TwiggyLawson (Chic Lady) and Steven Spielberg as the County Clerk.  A thoroughlyentertaining and enjoyable movie, filled with memorable scenes and linesyou\'ll be quoting for years to come (Aykroyd, in that `clipped\' Elwood Bluesdelivery, to Tucker McElroy:  `We\'ll, ah-- we\'ll talk to Bob--\'), `The BluesBrothers\' is a great film-- not in the sense of a film that should havewalked away with a bagful of Oscars, but great for what it is and for thespecial place it holds in the history of the cinema.  And, yes, it does havea place all it\'s own.  Because a movie doesn\'t have to be `Citizen Kane,\' or`Gone With the Wind\' to be `great.\'  It\'s the ones that make you feelsomething for whatever reason, or make you laugh; the ones you rememberbecause they\'re unique or have left their imprint on our culture in someway.  So, check `All of the above,\' or add your own reasons.  For all thatit\'s worth, this is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.  \t
