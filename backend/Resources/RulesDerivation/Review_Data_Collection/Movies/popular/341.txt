This Falcon entry (2/13) was played mainly for laughs, sometimesbordering on slapstick. The puns and wisecracks come thick and fastbetween the leading characters, all of them doubting everyone else\'sintelligence or honour. Wendy Barrie is almost manic in her assumedjealousy, James Gleason as the police Inspector is perfect and alwaysbrings his performance in "Arsenic and old lace" to my mind whenever Isee him. But it\'s George Sanders as the Falcon and Allen Jenkins as hissidekick Goldie that have the majority of the smart ass one-liners,Sanders\' body language is sometimes Music Hall but always believable.Scientist Alec Craig apparently murdered by a gang after his formula toproduce perfect synthetic diamonds, the Falcon unwillingly pulled intothe caper whilst urgently trying to get off to get married to thefrothing Barrie. As usual the entire NY police force was alerted toapprehend him as a murderer that no-one ever believes he really is. AndBarrie loves him with a passion even though she knows he\'ll always lovenearly all women. And Goldie stays with him wanting an easy life butknowing he\'ll never be getting one.Enjoyable film, 61 minutes short but a lot seems to happen. Ed Garganas Bates even shone here with a supreme show of brainpower!
