Intervista is one of the best films I\'ve ever seen. The strong sense inallFellini films that reality is like a big, sad circus is even stronger inthis film because fact and fiction, past and present become so confused.Thefictitious carnival appears to be reality. And isn\'t that maybe quite arealistic view?There is not only the usual sense of nostalgia: because the film looksbackat decades of Fellini nostalgia, the nostalgia is double. Who can watchtheolder Anita and Marcello looking back at La Dolce Vita with dry eyes? Theonly possible critic could be that the film is, like all Fellini movies,little coherent, but then, isn\'t that as well like lifeitself?Intervista maybe isn\'t the most famous Fellini films, it certainly is oneofthe better ones and with that one of the best films in cinematographichistory.
