Although the existing versions all have missing portions, and although thefilm is obviously old-fashioned in several respects, the original "The LostWorld" is still a fine film and very entertaining.  It has an exciting andinteresting story with some good characters and acting, and the dinosauraction, terrific for its time, is still quite watchable.Besides the adventure story about dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures,there is also some decent human drama with a few interesting characters. The earnest young journalist out to prove himself, the bad-tempered butbrilliant scientist, the devoted daughter searching for her missing father,and the rest, are all slightly exaggerated, but most also contain some realsubstance.  There is a good cast to bring these characters tolife.Naturally, the animals are the big stars, and although the special effectsdo not compare with what is done today, the dinosaur action is stillcreative, entertaining and worth watching.  There are also some good shotsof live animals living in the Amazon area where the expedition takesplace.This is certainly recommended for those who enjoy silent films.  It wouldalso be interesting viewing for those who are more used to modern films ofthe genre - you\'ll see a lot of the ideas that were later used in films thatare more familiar today.
