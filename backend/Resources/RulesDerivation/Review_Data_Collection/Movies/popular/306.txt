That Terminator-like metal skull with the pointy teeth and glowing redeye has absolutely nothing to do with this movie. That was obviouslyjust some ad executive\'s attempt to play on the popularity of"Ahnold\'s" film successes. Ditto for the tag line "The future is notfriendly." Instead, "Prototype" is a thoughtful, well played dramaabout two character\'s struggles to understand and deal with the worldaround them. Christopher Plummer is on solid ground as the scientistwho wants his creation to have a chance at life, and David Morse isspectacularly understated as the android prototype of the title.What makes this so compelling is the same thing that makes all of thebest science fiction or fantasy work: The principle players take thesituation and their part in it as real, without engaging inhistrionics. As Michael, Morse indulges in neither the overplayed"childlike wonder" nor the hyper-mechanical stiffness so often pouredinto similar roles by lesser actors. Michael is "other" without beingweird.Well worth a look.
