The cries, "Hey, Poncho! Hey, Cisco" are something none of us who grewup with this TV western will ever get out of heads and why should we? This western, I believe, is the second one I ever recall watching(after "The Range Rider") and the first recall with great fondness anda knowledge that a lot of people also liked this show. They had to, tohave it run six years.To be honest, I remember the Cisco Kid's partner, "Pancho" (LeoCarillo) more than I remember him, although Duncan Renaldo is notforgettable. He was a charismatic good guy, a real straight arrow and agreat role model for small kids. I was the perfect age (6-12) to enjoythese episodes of a western that was made more for us in mind thanadults.Pancho, if I recall, mainly provided comedy relief...and that was finewith us kids. We loved him. You couldn't ask for a more loyal sidekick,even if he wasn't the most brilliant person.
