I must discuss the Russian Yuri Norstein\'s stunning "Tale of Tales".  Likethe films of another great Russian filmmaker, Andrei Tarkovsky, this filmisabout memory and nostalgia.  The uses of various techniques of animation,primarily cutouts, not only let us see Norstein\'s memories, but also helpillustrate their dream-like qualities.  There are events in this filmthat,taken literally, could not have happened.  However Norstein representsthesememories metaphorically, thereby making their emotional impact greaterthanwere he to simply illustrate his memories in a straight forwardnarrative.There are a couple of moments that reflect the above-mentionedstatement that I feel I must include in this entry.  I loved the scenewherethe little boy is standing in the snow eating an apple , looking up atsomecrows on a tree branch.  The boy then appears on the branch, buddies upwiththe crows and shares his apple with them.  This is a great, moving, butnon-sentimental image that lets us feel the child\'s desire for friendship.Just after that, his father, whose Napoleon hat identifies him as atyrant,yanks him out of his daydream.  The little boy at first struggles, butthena little Napoleon hat appears on his head and he marches in file behindhisdad.  This scene reminded me of the Disney WWII era short "Education forDeath", in that it also is about childhood innocence being destroyed byadults conditioning their behavior.  But where "Education." was a didacticpropaganda tool, "Tale of Tales" simply shows how sad and unfortunate itisfor adults to do that to children, and illustrates it in such a poeticway.
