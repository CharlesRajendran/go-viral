Of the many movies I viewed in the early 50\'s, so many ,like now, wereheretoday, forgotten tomorrow. However some movies that became memorable andthat were able to make a dramatic impact on this young guy  include, Duelinthe Sun and  Gone with the Wind.   Strangely enough, Ace in the Hole isthemost memorable of all movies viewed. It is one that invades the mind andleaves one sad.Few films I remember as vividly as this dark movie, the images linger tohaunt me still.  \'Why?\' one might ask \'would a sombre movie like this madeover 50 years ago remain so memorable, when so many others have vanished.Was it the surreal inhumanity of the plot, the repugnant newsman devoid ofethics, the exploitation  of the trapped victim, the purposeful prolongingof the victim\'s entrapment to create a media frenzy, the ultimatecommercialcreation of an \'event\' style attraction complete with a circus likeatmosphere surrounding the cave while the victim remained entrapped andclose to death.\'Supposedly based on a real incident, it\'s a tough movie to watch and moresoif one is prepared to accept the premise that such inhumanity displayed inthe movie has an element of truth.I echo the desires of others to have the availability of this movie on VHSor DVD.  In the interim  my memory will continue to keep the imagesintact.See it if you can.
