1/ The music in this film is outstanding, with roles for ArethaFranklin, Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and more....that's not really surprising.2/ One of the finest car chases in cinematic history (The Italian Joband Smokey and the Bandit 2 are the only others that come close) 3/ John Belushi's own brand of comic genius throughout the movie 4/ Mulitiple memorable scenes and one liners5/ Cameos from Steven Spielberg, Twiggy, Frank Oz, etc.6/ Carrie Fisher as the psycho love interest intent on revenge.Nuff said, watch it and love it 10/10
