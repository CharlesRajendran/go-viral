I remember the TV series fondly. One of the Connecticut TV stations ranreruns in the late 1960s/early 1970s. I enjoyed it as a child. I justpicked up a bargain DVD with several episodes. Nothing is the same asan adult as when you first saw something as a child or teenager butthese hold up well.Some may see some ethnic stereotyping. Isn\'t that true for too manythings coming out of an earlier era. I would be interested in readingthe O. Henry story. Remember the dime novels of the late 1800s/early1900s led into the shorts and westerns of the early decades of Americanfilms.
