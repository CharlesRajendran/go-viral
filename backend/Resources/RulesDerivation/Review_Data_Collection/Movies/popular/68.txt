"Phone Call from a Stranger" tells the tale of four passengers(Merrill, Rennie, Wynn, and Winters) on a cross-country airplane trip.The four become friends and share personal thoughts before the planecrashes, killing all except Merrill, who sets out to contact therelatives of his dead friends. He finds that each family has a verydifferent story to tell, and each has its own issues arising from thedeaths of their relatives.Extremely well-acted, directed and scripted film also has harrowingairplane footage and a very good ending. Merrill is top form, as isWinters and especially Rennie, who is haunted by an accident in which acolleague was killed years earlier. Unlike many modern movies, this onereally leaves you with a profound message--the void that is left behindwhen someone suddenly dies.Try to see it if you can, my AMC tape is several years old and I\'veenjoyed this film many times. Just be warned--people scared of flyingmay cringe at the nighttime approach to the Vega airport.
