The plot of this film is fairly ordinary--bandleader/hoofer goes toHollywood and becomes a star, studio wants to play up his credentialsas a lover so they put the kibosh on announcing his marriage and cookup an on-set romance for the papers, the strain threatens his marriage.If it were with any other cast, that might have been the end of it. Butwith Cagney in the starring role, the movie just pops. The man had starquality positively oozing out of him, which had been evident from hisearliest bit roles, in films like "A Handful of Clouds."This was Cagney\'s second and last film with Grand National studios,where he\'d taken refuge during a contract dispute with Warner Brothers.The first film had cast him in standard dramatic fare, but this onereunited him with his NY dance coach, Harland Dixon, who staged thedances for the film. Cagney\'s dancing is even more spirited than in"Yankee Doodle Dandy"--at one point, where other dancers might kicktheir heels, he kicks his knees! According to a NY Times article citedin the AFI Catalog, Cagney practiced his steps with Fred Astaire beforefilming.What\'s most striking to me, though, in this film is Cagney\'sincomparably naturalistic acting. One scene in particular, where Cagneyphones his fiancée back in New York while sitting in the dark in hisHollywood apartment, and listens to her sing a new song, is as movingand realistic as anything I\'ve seen.Many scenes will evoke more famous moments from later films--Cagneydancing on piano keys, like Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia in "Big," orCagney working on his pear-shaped tones, like Gene Kelly in "Singin\' inthe Rain." Cagney gives them all his unique brand of liveliness. Thereis also an almost anachronistic recognition of the degradationHollywood visited on minorities, in the person of Philip Ahn, who playsCagney\'s manservant, Ito.Evelyn Daw, as Cagney\'s fiancée, was a discovery of the director,Schertzinger, and this was her first film. She\'s got a cute littlesmile, but her voice is absolutely wrong for the sort of band Cagney issupposed to be leading. She does well enough, though, and holds her ownwith William Frawley as Cagney\'s sympathetic press agent and GeneLockhart as the studio boss. The only real sour note is sounded by MonaBarrie, as the Hungarian star set up as Cagney\'s love interest by thestudio press machine. She\'s neither attractive nor talented, and onehas to wonder why she was supposed to be such a big star.This movie is out on DVD, unlike all too many of Cagney\'s earlyefforts, and it\'s worth checking out for a side of Cagney seen entirelytoo seldom.
