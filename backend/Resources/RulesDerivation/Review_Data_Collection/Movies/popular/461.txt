An early connecting lives film, much like a 1930s 'Pulp Fiction'without all the vulgar language and violence, it is very well done inmost aspects, and considering when it was made, it is well ahead of itstime. The film editing and the acting - especially from Gordon Harkerand Robertson Hare - are particularly strong points of the film, andthe overall product is engaging the whole time through. Arguably thereare at least one too many characters, which complexes the film muchmore than is necessary, however this hardly subtracts from this veryunique and highly interesting, but too often forgotten, early Britishfilm.
