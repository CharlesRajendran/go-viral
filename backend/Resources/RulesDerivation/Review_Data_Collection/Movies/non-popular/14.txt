There is such a lackluster quality about JUST AROUND THECORNER--everything from script to performances to the songs--is belowaverage. And Shirley is not quite as cute as the story wants her tobe--clearly, she is starting to develop into a chubby preteen youngsterwith just a modicum of talent left over from her earlier films as atot.Only a couple of the songs are pleasant enough to be worthmentioning--"A Happy Little Ditty" and "A Walk in the Rain" have thekind of charm expected in a Temple musical. But staging of the numbersand overall set decoration leaves a lot to be desired. Bert Lahr andJoan Davis are on hand as a chauffeur and a maid but both are defeatedby some flat one-liners. Charles Farrell is clearly past his career asa romantic leading man and is just so-so as Charlie\'s depressed fatheron the skids.For Temple fans only--weaknesses in both script and song numbers--andnot much else can be said for it. It\'s all very routine and quiteforgettable.
