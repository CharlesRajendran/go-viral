like every post apocalyse movie this one have the scenes into a junkyard,with garbage cars (I mean a pacer-buggy!!) and very very bad specialeffects.The only good actor for the psicopatic conduct is Brion James, a classicactor of the doomed future of mankind.If this movie have a big evaluation by IMDb users is for his homolog "DeadMan Walking" with Sean Penn and Susan sarandon, not foritself.
