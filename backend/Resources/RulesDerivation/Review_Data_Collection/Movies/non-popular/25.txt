I enjoyed this film, but must be nearly alone in not particularlyfinding Diana Wynyard appealing in any real way, in her role as theunhappy, abused wife. Jane Wyatt on the other hand, as her sister, issophisticated and lovely, very Myrna Loy. Having read lots of books set in Edwardian England, I am familiar withthe often ludicrous plots involved in setting up divorces and cases ofcriminal conversation. If you accept that the laws were limited andoften ridiculous, you can overlook what seems so old-fashioned.It is amusing to see Mrs. Patrick Campbell in action; she is a grandham. The part of the abusive husband is a stereotype; he is oily andcreepy and cruel. The new love is the opposite of course, charming andkind and gentle.Overall a well-made film; just wish it had been made a year earlierbefore the draconian production code took over.
