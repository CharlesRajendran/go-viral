I respect Christopher Plummer, playing against his typical villainouscharacter, and he is very convincing as a concerned scientist. Thesupporting cast is very good also. The plot alludes to "Frankenstein"numerous times and is obviously hinged on that classic tale. There isno excitement in this movie. It is so laid back, especially ArthurHill, Plummers adversary, that you begin to drift off early and often.Cerebral sci-fi doesn't have to be this boring (see "Enemy Mine"), andwhile the acting is totally acceptable, everything lacks excitement,and just drifts along towards a conclusion that was only a minorsurprise. Not recommended. - MERK
