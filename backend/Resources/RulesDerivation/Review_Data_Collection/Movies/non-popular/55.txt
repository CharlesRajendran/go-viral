Absolutely Abysmal Early Talkie Musical that is One of those that isTotally Forgotten and for Good Reason. It is an Example of HollywoodUnmasked for what it can be at its Worse. Even in 1930 this must havebeen Awful. Considering Neither the Director nor the Stars did AnythingWorth a Note After this Bomb.There is a Fat Leading Lady Singing and Dancing as a Wondrous StageStar and is the Blunt of Ugly and Weight Related Humor. There areJewish Comedians and Songwriters that are Stereotypical Embarrassing.One Staged Musical Extravaganza with Dozens of Shapely Girls inRotation and Counter Rotation that Anticipates Busby Berkley is aHighlight, but Mostly the Movie is a Tough Watch because it is So Datedthat it Cannot even be Seen as High Camp. It's just One Cringe InducingScene After Another. This One has been Relegated to the Dust Bin and Once in a While TCMBrushes it Off for a Screening, but that Only Reinforces its Place inwhat can Only be Described as a Pathetic Picture.
