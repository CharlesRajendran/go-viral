I\'m not a huge fan of Roy Rogers, though he has a lovely voice (and DaleEvans was CUTE!!). I don\'t particularly like musical westerns and singingcowboys (especially Gene Autry). And this is a fairly typical Roy Rogersfilm. The plot is interesting enough (and the film short enough) to keeponegoing, but thee films were churned out a mile a minute to keep the publichappy and the dollars rolling rolling rolling, so they weren\'t exactlyhighon quality. I really didn\'t like his sidekick Alkali (played by OlinHowlin)which didn\'t help much. But Roy was good as usual, Trigger was beautifulasusual, Dale Evans was CUTE as usual, but the film didn\'t live up to othersof his, or my expectations.Overall: I\'ve seen better, I\'ve seen worse. He beats Gene Autry by a milebut I prefer his TV show. Roy Rogers fans will probably like this a wholehell of a lot more...4/10.
