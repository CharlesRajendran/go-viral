Dr. Monica (Kay Francis) is a successful Obstetrician and is really,really wrapped up in her job--so much so that when her husband, John(Warren William), goes off to Europe on business for several months,Monica stays home. It's obvious that there are problems in thisrelationship but Monica doesn't know how deep they are, as John hasbeen having an affair with Mary (Jean Muir)! When Mary ends uppregnant, Monica treats her friend wonderfully...not realizing thatMary is a back-stabbing tramp. But, when Monica finally learns thetruth, Mary is in labor and Monica is forced to deliver the baby.However, although Monica is hurt and angry, she's also saint-like andeventually plans to let John go so that he can wed Mary. However, Maryand her friends realize that John really does love Monica and her plancannot be allowed to occur. So what will they do instead? Yep, leavethe baby with Monica, kill yourself so you won't be the one to break upthe marriage AND have Monica NEVER tell John the baby is biologicallyhis!!!This was one of the last Pre-Code films released by Hollywood. Itdebuted in June, 1934 and the new, tougher code went into effect thefollowing month. As a result, the film was soon pulled from circulationand not re-shown for some time due to its plot. Adultery was NOT to beallowed in films unless it was severely punished and Monica and John's'modern' sense of morality was definitely NOT allowed Post-Code. Forme, however, it's not the morality of the film that's a major issue butthe utter ridiculous way that Monica behaves. She is just toounderstanding, too nice and too unreal. I would have loved to have seenher enraged or downright hostile...instead she's too good and sweet tobe real. And, the ending, while satisfying in a Hollywood way, is alsocompletely ridiculous. A real disappointment.
