"Johnny Doesn't Live Here Any More" is a bad film...so bad that Ireally had to struggle to keep watching it. I noticed that most of thereviews were reasonably good with scores mostly in the 4-6 out of 10range...but I truly hated the movie and would never watch it again evenif I was paid to do so!The film is a VERY quirky comedy and this soon becomes obvious when agremlin (a very popular character created during WWII) appearsperiodically throughout the film. This mischievous jerk (voiced by MelBlanc...would would explain why it sounds just like Bugs Bunny) decidesto mess with Kathie (Simone Simon). It arranges it so she moves into anapartment that some jerk used before her--and he apparently gave outcopies of his keys to EVERYONE...neighbors, guys, women and strangers.This causes problems for Kathie...though if she'd just replaced thelock all this would have become moot.The film's problem is the writing. Most of it is simply not funny andtoo often the film creates quirky situations and characters instead ofjust making them interesting of truly creative. The gremlin gag wearsVERY thin very quickly....but so do most of the funny plot twists. It'sa shame, as some odd but interesting character actors appeared in thisone and I wanted to enjoy it. Imagine...Rondo Hatton and Froggy fromthe "Our Gang" shorts in the same movie!This film is simply a chore to watch and became tiresome...veryquickly.
