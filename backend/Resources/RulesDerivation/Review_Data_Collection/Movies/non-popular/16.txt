Obviously, this "Dead Man Walking" is not to be confused with the 1995Susan Sarandon movie of the same name. That movie was a qualityproduction, for one thing, and this movie isn't. I should mention thatI don't automatically look down at B movies - I watch them all thetime, and I find some of them to be enjoyable. But there's pretty muchnothing to enjoy in this movie. It's very cheap - it looks like it wasfilmed in junkyards and boring desert locations with nothing done tospruce these locations up. The low budget also means a lot of stuffhappens off camera (check the scenes where someone gets shot, forexample.) The screenplay doesn't feel like much thought was put into it- it seems at times they were making it up as they went along. Themovie does boast a somewhat impressive B movie cast - Hauser, James,and Combs - but they all seem to be running on autopilot. The onlymoment of interest in the movie is the sequence where two people playRussian roulette with a chainsaw, but the promising consequences ofthat are spoiled by the movie's previously mentioned habit of stuffhappening off camera.
