Joyce Reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of Janie, aboy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town America who ditches her steadyguy for a visiting soldier AND winds up on the cover of Life magazine(smooching at a blanket party) all in the same week! Non-stop barrageof wisecracks, put-downs, bull talk, and unfunny bits of business suchas Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (asthe maid) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis, Janie's motherinvolved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father trying to write aneditorial on the problems with today's teenagers (as the parents,stuffy, sexless Edward Arnold and pert, chatty Ann Harding make anunlikely couple, even for 1944; he looks incapable of helping toconceive a child much less raising two of them). Nominated for anAcademy Award (!) for Owen Marks' editing, Warner Bros. followed thisin 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have outgrown herco-horts by then--she was replaced by Joan Leslie. *1/2 from ****
