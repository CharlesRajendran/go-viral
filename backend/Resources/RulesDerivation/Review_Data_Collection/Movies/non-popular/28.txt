\'THE FUTURE IS NOT FRIENDLY\' intones the cover. While this may or maynot be true, the movie is set in 1983. I suppose that being suckeredinto buying this bargain DVD at Wal-Mart in 2005 is the unfriendlyfuture they were referring to.The cover art is a lie. There are no skeletal Terminator-style robotswith red eyeballs in this movie. The android guy wears a whiteturtleneck and is less threatening than Star Trek\'s Data, and hedoesn\'t do anything interesting. He\'s a wuss. This movie is crap.If you are responsible for the marketing of this DVD, you should beashamed of yourself.
