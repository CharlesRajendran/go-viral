If you want to excuse the mediocrity of "Children of Pleasure," you canpoint out that it was made in 1930 when movies were just learning totalk. On the other hand, over at Warner Bros., they were revving up thestyle and sparkle of "42nd Street" and the first "Gold Diggers" (bothreleased in 1933.)Aside from its clumsy title, "Children of Pleasure"has unimaginative production numbers (Busby Berkeley would cringe,) aleading man, Lawrence Gray, with no charisma, embarrassing ethnic humorand a creaky plot about a songwriter who falls for a phony society damebut doesn't realize that even at their wedding rehearsal, she'sthinking of divorce. Meanwhile, the secretary who truly loves him isprepared to hurl him at his heartless sweetheart. Talk about noblesacrifice! As a museum piece, it's worth watching. As entertainment,it's pretty grim.
