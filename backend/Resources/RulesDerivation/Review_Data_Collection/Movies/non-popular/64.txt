I don't care how much of a fan you are of Roy Rogers and DaleEvans--you've got to admit that this is a very bad film. In fact, it'sthe only film they made that truly made my skin crawl...it's THAT bad.Why is it so bad? Well, a pretty senorita is hurt very badly and Dalecomes up with an insane plan--to don a black wig and pose as aMexican!! I think that the Swedish Chef would have been moreconvincing! She is, to put it bluntly, absolutely terrible. Later, forno apparent reason, Roy tells everyone that he's killed thesenorita--and I have absolutely no idea why! On top of that, thewriting isn't very good and there is the usual Rogers/Evans clich√©where they meet and hate each other. A bad film in just about everyway...and dumb, dumb, dumb to boot.
