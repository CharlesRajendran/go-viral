Constance Bennett produced this vehicle for herself, which was a fairlytypical postwar story of Resistance heroism in Paris (no real locationshooting, alas). Constance Bennett had plenty of energy but by thisstage in her career she had no genuine charm. She battles her waythrough the part with determination, but just cannot engage the viewer.Her performance is too mannered, too exterior. Her chum Gracie Fields(in her last film role) does far better, is amusing, watchable, andengaging. A smoothie Frenchman, George Rigaud, plays Bennett's Frenchhusband, and he is very convincing at it. Young Kurt Kreuger isexcellent as the Gestapo captain with whom Bennett forms an ambivalentsemi-romantic friendship, while she is at the same time spiritingdowned American and British airmen out of France with the aid of theResistance. The film is not so bad one wouldn't want to watch it, butit avoids being good. Gregory Ratoff directed it, and it is not one ofhis finest achievements. If you are uncritical of such films, and donot expect too much, this could afford some diversion.
