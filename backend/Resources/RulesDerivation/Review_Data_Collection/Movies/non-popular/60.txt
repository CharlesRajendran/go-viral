Here Comes Trouble (1948) ** (out of 4) Another in the Hal Roach series featuring Doubleday (William Tracy) andAmes (Joe Sawyer). This time out the two are out of the Army andDoubleday, thanks to his soon to be father in law, is working as areporter and he tries to crack a big case against a gangster. Ames,working as a policeman, gets in and tries to help but of course chaosfollows. I believe this is the fifth film I've seen with the duo andthere's no doubt that this one here is the weakest. The previous filmswere always going for laughs but this one here really seems a tad bitlazy because it seems not much of an effort was given in the screenplayto try and get any laughs. For the most part you get a lot of dialogueand none of its funny. Not because the material bad but because thematerial doesn't even go for laughs. Tracy is his usual self here butSawyer seems really bored because his comic flair is never seen,although, to his credit, the screenplay doesn't offer him too much.Another problem is that most of the film's in the series ran from 40-45minutes but this one here clocks in at 55-minutes and it really feelslike 55-hours.
