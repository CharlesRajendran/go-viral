Let me explain: "My Woman" comes from the same studio as Moe, Larry,and Curly, and what they have in common is minimal production values--though less effort was, of course, put into Three Stooges shorts thaninto feature films, even one as tossed-off (and poorly titled) as thisone.According to Wikipedia: "During the 1930s, the eight majors averaged atotal of 358 feature film releases a year." That's about one movie fromeach studio every eight days. "My Woman" was from Columbia, whichwasn't even a major in the 30's, so they had even fewer resources, andit shows in their products, which were cranked out like jelly beans.Among the victims of Hollywood's factories was the star of this film,Helen Twelvetrees, a cute and competent platinum blonde from Brooklyn.She made 33 movies in her brief 10-year career, and none were much morefamous than this one. She died, aged 49, a suicide.The plot is so ordinary it hardly bears revealing-- wife helps husbandwith radio career, husband gets famous and insufferable, wife has tochoose between him and lusting producer. Roughly. There was only one scene I really enjoyed, an extended comic riff abouthalf an hour in. The omnipresent character actor Charles Lane (350screen credits!) brings a batch of clients to audition for some verybored radio executives. One audition is worse than the next, but themost preposterous by far is a young (39 at the time) Walter Brennan asa stuttering actor whose act is animal noises. Reeaallly lousy animalnoises, which cannot be easy to perform. He's halfway through his SouthAmerican fauna when he's yanked. "You're off the air old man," thestage hand says when he takes the mike. "Nerts to you," stuttersBrennan.He's the only character I wanted more of.
