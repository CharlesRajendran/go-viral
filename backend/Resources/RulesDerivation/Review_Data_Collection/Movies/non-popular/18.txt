The first film shot in 3D finds an inebriated Robert Stack pining awayfor his fianc√© and trying to get a railway constructed in the heart ofAfrica at the turn of the last century. He's in British EquatorialAfrica which later became Kenya colony and where the Sahara meets theveld. What's stopping the progress of the colonial British dream of arailway from Capetown to Cairo is a pair of lions.These two lions have the natives scared out of their wits. Lions arenot known to attack humans, you leave them alone and they'll leave youalone unless they're hungry. But these two, a male and female havedeveloped a real taste for human flesh. Showing no fear of man oranything man made, they attack humans indiscriminately at will. No onewants to work until this lion problem is solved.Stack's got both a lion problem and an unsatisfied testosteroneproblem. The second is remedied by the arrival of Barbara Britton, noone it seems can deal with the first.Bwana Devil was shot in Africa and it's writer Arch Oboler owes a lotto Moby Dick. These two lions and Stack's obsession with them are takenfrom the Herman Melville classic. Good thing Barbara Britton arrivedwhen she did, she provides something Captain Ahab didn't have.Best scene in the film and it's almost laughable was when these threewhite hunters, best in their line of work are imported by the railroadto kill these lions. So what do the lions do, but actually enter theprivate railroad car where the hunters are hoisting a few with NigelBruce who plays Stack's sidekick and a doctor and proceed to kill themall and carry the cadavers off for a later snack. Presumably based on a true story according to the credits, don't youbelieve it. The 3D jungle scenes are nice, but it's attached to oneridiculous story.
