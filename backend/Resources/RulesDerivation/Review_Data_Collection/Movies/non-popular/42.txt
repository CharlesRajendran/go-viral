Wildcat Bus (1940) ** (out of 4) Warner made a crime picture about taxi drivers in the entertainingTAXI! so I guess RKO thought they'd push the envelope by making a crimepicture with bus drivers. This film, however, is pretty dull from startto finish. In the film a playboy (Charles Lang) goes bankrupt so he hasto get a job at a bus company ran by a woman (Fay Wray) and her father.The bus company has had all sorts of accidents that are ruining theircompany but they begin to think that it's racketeers running a taxiservice that's trying to steal their business. This RKO picture runs avery brief 63-minutes but at times it feels doubt that length. Thebiggest problem is the rather bland direction that puts very littlelife into the picture. The screenplay really doesn't help matterseither as all the characters are pretty one-dimensional and none areoverly interesting. The bad guys are carbon copies of what you'd see ina Warner picture and the good guys are just boring and constantlysaying bad jokes. Lang is okay in his role but the screenplay prettymuch lets his character done as at times he's annoying and it's reallyhard to care too much for him. Wray is pretty much going by the numbersbut once again, a lot of this could be blamed on the screenplay ordirection. Paul Guilfoyle, Don Costello, Paul McGrath and Joe Sawyerround out the supporting players. There's very little energy toanything in the film as the entire story just feels forced and it'sjust not interesting enough to carry the short running time. The endingpicks up a few punches as we get a big fight sequence with plenty ofpunches and kicks.
