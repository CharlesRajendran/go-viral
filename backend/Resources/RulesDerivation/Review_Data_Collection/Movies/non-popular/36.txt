Three carnival workers romance the same girl until WWI interferes withtheir plans. They join the Navy and the plot meanders all over theplace with tiresome effect.WILLIAM BOYD (later "Hopalong Cassidy") spouts his dialog in aslow-moving way, and ROBERT ARMSTRONG and JAMES GLEASON mug their waythrough some silly shenanigans as sailors looking for a good time. Boydis the Chief Petty Officer who comes out of retirement to rejoin theservice. GINGER ROGERS is the carnival gal who can't seem to decidewhether to get serious about Boyd or not, until the finale.It's hopelessly contrived and full of hokey situations, dated dialogand interesting only for a glimpse of the Naval ships.Summing up: Totally unsatisfying from almost every standpoint.
