"The President", known as Carl Theodor Dreyer's first feature-lengthfilm, includes a trial scene, solved in a traditional way, a strongcontrast with his famous masterpiece "Passion of Jeanne d'Arc". Ingeneral, the "mise-en-caméra" is rather conventional, except for acouple of shots, both related to romantic situations in which thefilmmaker was "inspired": one is a overhead shot of a kiss, the othertwo lovers' reunion on a bridge reflected on a pond. There are a fewsilly distracting shots dealing with puppies; one or two insertsseemingly erroneous, but in any case, it is an enjoyable viewing, andDreyer's ethical considerations and spiritual leaning which reached asublime level in "Ordet"- are already sketched here.
