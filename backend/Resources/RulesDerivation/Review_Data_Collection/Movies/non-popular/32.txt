Kay Francis is successful Dr. Monica Braden, married and madly in lovewith John Braden (Warren William). Her big sorrow is that she can'tconceive, and we learn as the film goes along that she will never beable to conceive. The film opens at a gathering, and we find out fairlyquickly that John was having an affair with Mary Hathaway (Jean Muir),but he broke it off. He tells her to forget him.Monica and Mary are friends, and Mary has fainting spells - which inold movies could mean only one thing. Never stated, however. Pregnant.Not only that, but she never looked pregnant. Monica promises to helpMary every step of the way. And she does, until she finds out that thebaby is her husband's.This is dated and preposterous. Was Dr. Monica trying to be a candidatefor sainthood? Kay is glamorous, and there's a nice performance fromVerree Teasdale.Precode and a typical Kay Francis melodrama. I don't know of any womanwho would behave as she did, pre or post-code.
