The box says Night of the Zombies but the opening titles say Night of theZombies 2.  I\'ll call it Part 2 and call it a bad Part 2 at that.  If you\'rewatching a zombie movie about Nazi\'s, it\'s bound to be bad.  Zombie Lake,Bloodsucking Nazi Zombies, they\'re all terrible.  This one is a real snoozercomplete with stock footage of the Pentagon and laughing zombies.  Thefunniest thing though is the props: radiation detector (hair dryer) and foamsprayer (jet pack from a 50\'s sci-fi flick).  The twist ending is not bad,but most people will quit watching after the first ten minutes.  I know Iwanted to.  Even the most hardcore zombie fans will get no enjoyment out ofthis movie."We zombies are destined to rule the universe."
