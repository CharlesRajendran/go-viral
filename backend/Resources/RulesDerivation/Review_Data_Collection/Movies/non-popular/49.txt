In a western cave, white William S. Hart (as Black Deering), leader ofthe outlaw Raiders, feels the law crashing in on his gang's crimespree. Fellow bandit Joseph Singleton (as Tom Jordan) thinks Mr. Hartis chicken, and goads his rival and the gang into one more heist. Ofcourse, as Hart feared, things go all wrong. Later, on the lam fromboth Jordan and the law, Hart hides out with lonely white Anna Q.Nilsson (as Mary Brown). Ms. Nilsson is living alone with son RichardHeadrick (as "The Little Feller"), since the disappearance of herhusbandÂ… "The Toll Gate" delivers the expected Hart western elements; however,they do not coalesce. It's a little unpleasant to start off with Hartdisarmed by his gang's "mutiny", but nice to see him tough it out.Watch for a pivotal scene wherein Hart opens Nilsson's Bible: in it, hereads the verse "By their fruits ye shall know them" and locates aphotograph which reveals something important about the film. The "bytheir fruits" theme is completely illogical if you think about thephotograph. Also, Hart's cabin revelation is rather foolishly timed;obviously, it should have been made some minutes later (relating itmore to Singleton's threat). ****** The Toll Gate (4/15/20) Lambert Hillyer ~ William S.
