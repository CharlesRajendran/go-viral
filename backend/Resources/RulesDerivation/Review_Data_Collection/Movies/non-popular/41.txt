When the film begins, Nadine (Anna Sten) is working hard practicing forher citizenship exam. She desperately wants to become a US citizen.However, when her boss, the Professor, is murdered, the policeinexplicably blame her and are going to deport her!Soon she's on a train headed to New York for the deportation and alongare a host of other deportees including a one-dimensional communist anda gangster. You know that SOMETHING bad will prevent the train fromarriving in New York--either other gangsters or spies will soon bearriving. Soon Nadine and a very stereotypical reporter are off thetrain--running cross country while being chased by evil folks.This film is obviously a very low-budget B-movie. Like many Bs, thisone was hastily written and has a few broad and annoying characters andisn't especially enjoyable. It also makes very little sense most of thetime. It's obvious that realism is NOT a strong point in this movie!Overall, the film offers few flashes of brilliance and is, at best, atime-passer.
