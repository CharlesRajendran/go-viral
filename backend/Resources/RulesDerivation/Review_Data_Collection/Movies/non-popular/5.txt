As a history teacher and lover of films, I occasionally like watchingcartoons that have been banned, as they tell us a lot about our societyand how far we have come over the years. What was perfectly acceptabledecades ago is now, in some cases, seen as gross and inappropriate.Occasionally, these cartoons which have been removed from screeningaren't particularly offensive but often, as in the case of thiscartoon, they are so god-awful it's hard to imagine that people wouldhave laughed at and enjoyed these films! Thirteen of these cartoonshave been packaged together on a DVD entitled "Cartoon Crazys: Bannedand Censored" and while the print quality of many of the cartoons isless than stellar, it's a great chance to see how sensibilities havechanged.This cartoon starts off in a rather clever and innocent way. You seethe Fleischer Studio where the Betty Boop cartoons are made. Betty ison the drawing pad and the illustrator (supposedly Max Fleischerhimself) is leaving for the day. Once gone, the ink well bounces aboutand Koko the Clown comes bounding out of it. Unfortunately, though, hehas a bad toothache and so it's up to "Betty the Pusher" to solve theproblem! In a very weird and very inappropriate scene, Betty playsdentist and gives Koko laughing gas. Not only that, but the gas ends upgoing everywhere and getting all the neighbors stoned as well. And,since everyone is having a wonderful time and the gas is so much fun,you assume the cartoon encouraged the audience members to give it a trythemselves! Fortunately, this seeming endorsement of becoming a stonerwas pulled from the market as it really shows no down side for druguse!! It's all pretty creepy, but the cartoon is also better than usualfor a Betty Boop cartoon due to its clever introduction.
