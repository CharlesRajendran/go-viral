Menace from Outer Space is yet another TV movie made by editing threeepisodes of the Rocky Jones, Space Ranger TV series together. This showwas quite obviously aimed at a family audience, mainly at children. Inthis entry a couple of missiles strike earth from a moon of Jupiterhitherto thought to not have any inhabitants, Rocky Jones and his creware sent off to investigate.As with other entries in this series, the film is full of rubbishcharacters and terrible dialogue. Which wouldn't really matter but forthe fact it's all awfully tedious and hard work to sit through. If I ambeing charitable I would have to say that it is a very early example ofa TV movie and so its extreme clunkiness is perhaps to be expected andcould be regarded as historically interesting as an example of early TVsci-fi. And it also has to be admitted that it was meant for kids, socan hardly be blamed for not appealing to this adult sixty years later.But, you know what? Even taking all of this into account I stillthought this was diabolical stuff. Slagging it off does feel a littlelike kicking a puppy, albeit a pretty annoying puppy.
