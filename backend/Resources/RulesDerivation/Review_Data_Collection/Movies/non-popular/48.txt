There are so Many Names of Outlaws and Such in this Murky Story ofBandits and Marshalls that in the End it is just One Big...Ho-Hum. ThisWestern from RKO has a Good Look about it but what it's About isAnybody's Guess.Randolph Scott is OK but is Not the Stoic, Sombre Presence that HeAssumed in the Budd Boetticher Classics. Here He is just RandolphScott, Tall and Unwavering. The Cast has some Familiar Faces and someNot So Familiar to Casual Moviegoers.Gabby Hayes is just a Heartbeat from Irritating and is Most Effectivewith a Double Take Glance than with that Grovely, Grating Galoot of aVoice that is So Recognizable. He has Much to Do in this MediocreWestern and is as Good as Anybody here.There is a Boring Horse Race Among other Boring Things in this LongStory that is Never Woven Together Adequately. Lawrence Tierney isWasted as Jesse James as is just about Everyone Else. The Movie Needsmore Edge and more Grit, because as it Stands it is a Plate Full ofCampfire Comfort that Almost Works but Ultimately is Nothing More thanName Dropping.
