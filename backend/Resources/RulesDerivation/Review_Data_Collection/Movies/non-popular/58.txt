Lightweight Propaganda that is Family Friendly Fodder and Heavy on theIrish-are-Americans Theme, as well as the Need to Include those CuteKids as a Reminder of what We are Fighting for. Speaking of Fighting,those Irish will Fight at Any Opportunity. They will Fight and Arguewith Family Members, Friends, Co-Workers and even the Nazis.In the Middle of the Movie it Stops Dead to Include a Scene where theShipbuilders Remove their Welder's Helmets so the Audience can SeeEveryone is Doing their Part...Negroes...Women...and an Oriental (hadto be Chinese because the Japanese were in Internment Camps).Pat O'Brien is Miscast Again Playing a Hunk that Every Woman on ScreenPines. Ridiculous. The Frumpy, Overweight, Hardly Handsome "Star",should have Traded Places with Chester Morris and it would have Workeda Whole Lot Better.Carol Landis is a Sleek Beauty and some of the Cinematography is AboveAverage. Overall it is a Watchable Piece of Propaganda Fluff that isNeither that Suspenseful or Intriguing. In the Prolog it is Mentionedthat America is Building Sturdy Ships, Honest Ships. What Exactly is anHonest Ship?
