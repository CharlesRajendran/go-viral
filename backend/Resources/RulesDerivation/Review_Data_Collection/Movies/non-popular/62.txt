I pretty much agree with the lukewarm review here entitled "Mediocrewar heroine tale." This is far from a "gem," as some people would haveit.The plot keeps moving and is mildly interesting, although withoutfinger-biting suspense. We know pretty well how each situation willturn out, the romance, the hair's-breadth escapes, and so on. As theend approaches there is a little surprise, but it's all fixed up withinminutes as victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat and medals arepinned on the heroines. Ho-hum. I barely kept myself from turning offthe television.Outdoor scenes are all shot in studio and look very fake. The foggynight scene in the fields--puleeze! The music has moments when it goesover the top.Although the movie is set in France, French characters areinsignificant, while the American and English ladies are large,ultimately heroic presences. It's certainly a narrow, nationalisticvision of "Paris underground." I did find it refreshing to see a movie,especially one focused on the conflicts of war, in which the leadcharacters are female.Don't get excited about seeing this. Don't set aside important time forit. But if you run into it accidentally, you probably won't think it'sa total waste of time.I believe this film was also released with the title "MadamePimpernel."
