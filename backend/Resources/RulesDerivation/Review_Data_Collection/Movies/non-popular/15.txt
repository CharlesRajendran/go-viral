Tom is teaching a kitten (yet another new character) the rules of beinga house cat; as he tries his best to get his student's attention, Jerrythe mouse does his utmost to disturb the lesson, even going so far asto teach the young cat that 'mice and cats should be friends'.Tom, naturally upset that a mouse is undermining his authority, nowtries to teach Jerry the error of his ways with the usual violentresults.It pains me to say this, but this cartoon is pretty much a laugh freezone, going for cuteness (with the mouse and kitten becoming friends)rather than delivering the hilarity fans have come to expect from theseries.And is it my imagination, or is this the second consecutive adventurefor the guys that features inexplicable musical cues from The Wizard ofOz? Weird!
