Roy Rogers is an oil prospector who wants to get rights to drill foroil on a promising piece of land. Dale Evans (as Billie) sails a localtugboat named "Apache Rose" and Olin Howlin is Mr. Rogers' lovable oldcodger friend "Alkali". Bob Nolan and the "Sons of the Pioneers" arearound when necessary. Gamblers aboard the boat "Casino Del Mar" aka"S.S. Casino" are the main adversaries, led by nasty George Meeker (asReed Calhoun). This film is very poorly performed and presented byRogers and company. Ms. Evans is absurd as a disguised Senorita, andher song "There's Nothing' Like Coffee in the Morning" looks like abreakfast commercial try-out. Mr. Howlin's quickly disappearing "blackeye" might have been better placed on the entire disjointed production. * Apache Rose (2/15/47) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, OlinHowland, George Meeker
