There was an interesting aspect of this film: Golan, Globus and DanWolman made two versions of this film. One was a PG version that theyhoped to sell to T.V. and the R-Rated one that was filled with nudity.18 year-old Katya Berger bares a lot of skin in this costume dramaabout a young Parisian lady who finds work at a burlesque club and thentakes advantage of the perverts who come here. The film takes place inthe 1880's yet one of the stars of the club has created movies. Notvery exciting and very tame for today's standards. A turn-off in thisfilm is the women who didn't shave under the arms. Ewww. MandyRice-Davies, who helped bring down the British Government years ago,appears in this film. Costume drama for completists or those who wantto see a poor man's Brooke Shields.
