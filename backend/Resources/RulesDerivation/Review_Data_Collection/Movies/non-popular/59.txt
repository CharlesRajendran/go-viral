World War II spy thriller, taking place in a ship-building plant, withPat OBrien, who made a whole lotta movies, mostly war times. CarolLandis, who made a good number of movies, but committed suicide at anearly age, shortly after making, ironically, "The Noose". SecretCommand was nominated for an Oscar, but was up against "30 seconds overTokyo" (S Tracy, V Johnson,R Mitchum), so of course, it didn't have achance. I thought the suspense-full high crane scenes were actuallypretty good, considering when this was made, in spite of the liberaluse of back-mats throughout the film. The sound also cuts out severaltimes, and I wondered if it was dialogue editing, poor recordingquality, or the fault of my local cable company. (was shown on TurnerClassic Movies in June 2007). see my entry in message boards for thisfilm for additional observations and shortcomings in the script.
