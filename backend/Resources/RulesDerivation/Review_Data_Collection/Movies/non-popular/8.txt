Perhaps it's just me, but I felt that the basic plot for this short wasa bit creepy. Edgar Bergen (here called 'Dr. Bergen') owns a tinyorphanage. Huh?! Regardless of how strange this is, he announces that arich lady is coming to pick one of the kids to adopt and they shouldall be on their best behavior. One of the kids, Charlie McCarthy, hasno interest in being adopted by the old woman--instead he wants to makepasses at the young and very pretty lady who is visiting. And, in theend, Charlie ends up mucking up things.Among Edgar Bergen's films, this certainly it not one of the funnierones. But, it is slight and enjoyable--with Charlie behaving in hisusual cheeky manner. It's all quite interesting but certainly not amust-see.
