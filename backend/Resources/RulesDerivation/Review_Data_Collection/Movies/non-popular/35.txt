"Suicide Fleet" is an amazingly dull film about three guys (two ofwhich are real jerks) in the US Navy. All three (William Boyd, JamesGleason and Robert Armstrong) are in the navy and are infatuated with ayoung lady (Ginger Rogers). However, she loves Boyd and the other twospend much of the movie lying to their 'friend' and trying to steal thegirl for themselves. These antics were very tedious and the chemistrybetween these three is quite poor--making it difficult to like them orcare about them.The three eventually volunteer for special duty about a sailing shipthat looks similar to a German one that has been disguising itself as aNorwegian fishing boat. The plan is that when the subs come to refueland be refitted, they'll alert the American fleet to intercept them.Despite a fairly interesting plot, the film suffers from uninspiredacting, dull characters and a need for more action. I've seen quite afew other military films made in the 1930s--most of which were franklya lot more interesting than this one. Aside from a chance to see GingerRogers before her big Hollywood makeover or Boyd before he re-createdhimself as Hopalong Cassidy, there isn't a lot to recommend this one.
