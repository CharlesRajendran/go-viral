    Just to add to the previous comments who all noted how good thisbittersweet mature musical is- I think it just missed being a classic , inspite of all of its fine attributes, because its score is on the ordinaryside. That said-Gene Kelly\'s rollerskate number is as good as his famed soggy solo in Singing in the Rain-it is absolutely breathtaking. And the 3friends dance with garbage cans on their feet is great. The most surprisingis the heartbreaking solo of Dan Dailey. What a performance! He is supposedto be a self loathing ad exec who proceeds to get very drunk at a party andeven dances with a  cliched lampshade on his head. He never loses hisdignity, as he dances with grace  and agility ,all the while , convicing usthat he\'s quite drunk.   One thing I noticed in the plot. The old war buddies can only bond againafter a huge brawl in which they relive their war days and beat up thegangsters. Then they can drink together and let their sensitive sides showand sing about old friendships. At the movies end, Dan Dailey is able toreunite with his unseen wife. He phones her and tells her that he loves her.Kelly is able to go off with Cyd Charisse and Michael Kidd goes back to the"sticks" and his big Italian family and his hamburger joint. The movie endson a bittersweet note-the three pals go their separate ways. We don\'t hearthem  make any plans to meet again.Yet, we don\'t feel they need to-theystill don\'t have anything in common in the real world. However, in themagical musical world they took from each other what they needed and are nowable to accept their somewhat disapointing yet very human realities. Theyeach have grown up and  have found  more mature relationships with theirwives and with themselves. The movie\'s title is ironic- It isn\'t always fairweather and real  life can be disappointing but we can still findcontentment.
