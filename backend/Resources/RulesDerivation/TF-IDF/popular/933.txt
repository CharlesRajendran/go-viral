I feel almost provoked to comment on this film here, and I say this notas an especially religious person (which I am not), but as someone whofeels that a film should not be unfairly criticized because ofsomeone's faulty--or would it be more accurate to say willfully (?) --distorted summary of the plot.SPOILERS AHEADTo begin with, Marcelino is bitten by the scorpion while he is playingoutside the monastery, but at no point in the film does he ask to seethe crucifix for any reason. He has been frightened by tales of a"bogeyman" in the attic by the monks, who wish him to stay away fromit. OUT OF CURIOSITY, and for no other reason, he ventures in, sees theChrist figure, thinks it is the feared bogeyman, and tears back downthe stairs. (The figure, incidentally, is a beautiful wooden carving,not gory in the least.)After an unfortunate incident, in which he is taken to a festival andunwittingly causes a commotion by accidentally letting some animals runwild, the new mayor, an enemy of the monks who have raised Marcelino,swears to shut down the monastery. Marcelino is given the silenttreatment by the monks, and it is then that he goes again to the attic,realizes the "bogeyman" is only a statue of Christ, remarks that itlooks hungry, steals some bread, and offers it to the statue. It isthen that a miracle occurs---the statue comes to life, eats the bread,and eventually, because of Marcelino's repeated visits, becomesMarcelino's teacher and confidant (Marcelino realizes who he is). Andthe vision is *not* a hallucination. The statue's final act in the filmis intended only as a reward for Marcelino's kind actions, and it isdone at Marcelino's innocent, but completely self-aware, request.This is by no means a vicious, sadistic film; it is a beautiful, gentleone. It is a pity that there are those who would distort its meaning.
