THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES takes him into deadly conflict withBritain's most dangerous criminal mastermind, Professor Moriarty.20th Century Fox takes us back to the foggy London streets of 1894 inthese exciting exploits of the world's most famous private consultingdetective. The production values are of a high order in this storybased on William Gillette's stage play about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'scelebrated characters. Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce return as Holmesand Watson, perfectly portraying that legendary literary partnershipwith good grace and cheerfulness, Rathbone allowing some traces ofhumanity to infuse Holmes' cerebral haughtiness, and Bruce, bumblingand big-hearted, enacting the embodiment of a staunch companion andfriend.Unfairly relegated to 6th place billing is George Zucco, marvelous asMoriarty. He presents us with a consummate villain of enormousintellect & subtle nuance, a monster passionate about his exotic plantsbut indifferent to human life. It is highly enjoyable watching him plota dastardly crime while engaging in a masterful duel of wits withHolmes.The other roles are also very well cast and highlight some fine Britishcharacter actors: lovely Ida Lupino as a young woman frantic over anunknown evil stalking her family; handsome Alan Marshal as her family'slawyer; dignified Henry Stephenson as the worried Constable of theTower of London; E.E. Clive as the dogged Scotland Yard inspector; andMary Forbes as a kindly noblewoman who befriends Miss Lupino.Some rather brief performances also enhance the whole: Mary Gordon asHolmes' grandmotherly landlady and young Terry Kilburn as his page boy;Peter Willes as Miss Lupino's terrified brother; elderly Frank Dawsonas Moriarty's harassed butler; Holmes Herbert as a highly frustratedLaw Court Justice; and William Austin as a stranger who has a peculiarencounter with Watson on a London sidewalk.Two lighthearted moments especially standout -- Rathbone delightfullyin disguise, and, at the very conclusion of the film, Watson deftlyturning the tables on Holmes.This was the second in a series of Holmes films starring Rathbone &Bruce which began at Fox Studios. It followed THE HOUND OF THEBASKERVILLES (1939) and, after the jump to Universal Studios, precededSHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) three years later.
