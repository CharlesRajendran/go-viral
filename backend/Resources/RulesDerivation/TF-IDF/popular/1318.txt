One of the best war movies ever made, directed by Lewis Milestone (AllQuieton the Western Front), this movie is distinguished by its depiction ofwarfrom the soldier\'s individual point of view. Unlike most war movies, thisisinfantry combat as seen through the eyes of several members of a platoonasit walks through the Italian countryside in 1943 on its way to seize aGerman observation post. In all the action sequences, you never seeanythingthat the individual soldier (German, Italian or American) depicted on thescreen doesn\'t see. You only see what is happening around him as he seesit.I\'ve seen them all, and no other director ever approached war filmingthisway. And I can tell you personally that this is the way it was in combat.The only errors in the entire movie involved grenades: you don\'t blowbridges with them and you don\'t pull their pins with your teeth--that\'sthebest way I know of pulling out a tooth w/o a dentist\'s helping hand. Alandmark movie made during the war and only released after the war endedin1945 because of the final scenes. Matched only by William Wellman\'s "AStoryof GI Joe," this is the best film on infantry combat produced from WorldWarII.  Yes, yes, I\'ve seen "Saving Private Ryan."  Except for the shock ofthefirst 20 minutes, it\'s Steven Spielberg\'s three-star remembrance of hisboyhood comic book war stories.
