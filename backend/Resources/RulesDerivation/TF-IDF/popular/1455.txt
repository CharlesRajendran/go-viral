"The Holly and the Ivy" is the only realistic Christmas movie of the1950\'s.It tells the story of an English minister, Ralph Richardson,  and histhreeconflicted adult children: Margaret Leighton, Celia, Johnson, and DenholmElliott.  Everybody in the cast does a great acting job. This is Mr.Richardson\'s last great role as a leading man in a movie.The story is like riding a roller coaster.  Christmas should be a calmtimefor families, but it is not for this English family. This movie is aforgotten gem.
