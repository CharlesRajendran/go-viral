Domestic difficulties between the strong-willed Queen of Sylvania andher stubborn Consort may cause them both to miss THE LOVE PARADE.Director Ernst Lubitsch spread his special brand of sophisticatednaughtiness in this visually impressive & engaging early talkiemusical. Depending much on the intelligence of the viewer, the filmserves up unexpected bons mons of wit (e.g. the dog barking hisfarewells to the pooches of Paris) which never fail to enchant.Lubitsch would contribute a series of delightful little comedies overthe next several years, making the title of this confection pertinentin more ways than one.Maurice Chevalier practically oozes Gaelic charm in a wonderfullyhammy, ingratiating performance. His French charisma dominates thescreen; he embraces his songs rather than just singing them. Hisimmense joie de vivre & exceptional talent was perfectly attuned to thesound motion picture. In her film debut, the lovely Jeanette MacDonaldproves a charming partner to Chevalier. Imperious or coquettish byturns, she beguiles the viewer as well as Maurice--her celebrated voice(when intelligible) put to good use in the seduction.British physical comedian Lupino Lane is a winner as Chevalier\'s highlyenergetic little valet; lanky Lillian Roth, as a palace maid, joins himfor some humorous knockabout songs. Lionel Belmore & Eugene Palettebring appropriately hefty gravitas to their roles as governmentministers. Diminutive Edgar Norton appears as an unflappable majordomo.Movie mavens will recognize silent screen comic Ben Turpin as across-eyed lackey, Russ Powell as the Afghan Ambassador and young JeanHarlow as one of a group of women applauding Chevalier at the theatre,all uncredited.
