This is joyful film-making, and what a cast! Thelma Ritter, always thebest thing about the acclaimed ALL ABOUT EVE, is beyond delightful inher starring role. Gene Tierney, gowned by Oleg Cassini, at the peak ofher beauty--and talented, too! These elements combined with a reliablesupporting cast (including a perfectly snotty Miriam Hopkins), soliddirection, and a great screenplay, make THE MATING SEASON a must-see(and, if possible, own)! This is the kind of human comedy which can, and will, elevate or softenthe mood of even the most ardent cynic. How can one resist the lovableThelma Ritter in a role that must have been tailor made for hertalents? Give this little-known gem a try.
