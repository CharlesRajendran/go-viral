I didn\'t know anything about this film and couldn\'t find any reviewsanywhere but the one comment here so I went ahead and took a chance andrecorded it. I am SO glad I did. It\'s a great little mystery. I had NO ideawho the murderer was and was suprised at the end of the film. Why don\'ttheymake these kind of movies anymore? Also, the acting was very good. AlineMcMahon and Guy Kibbee were great together!
