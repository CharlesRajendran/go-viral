MURDER ON THE BLACKBOARD is good old-fashioned fun with Edna May Oliver, myfavorite character actress of the \'30s, sleuthing in Nancy Drew manner withJames Gleason at her side as a crusty detective. This time the amateur sleuth helps solve a case involving a murdered musicteacher and gets herself into deep trouble with the killer who meansbusiness when he tries to throw an axe at her in a dark basement cellar.Edna May\'s brisk, no nonsense manner fits the character of HildegardeWithers to perfection and she\'s never at a loss for a quick retort whenGleason becomes a bit overbearing. Their game of one-up-man-ship is whatkeeps the story moving briskly to a satisfying conclusion.The fact that it\'s terribly dated in dialogue and situations is what givesthis little mystery a quaint sort of charm. One of the better in a series ofHildegarde Withers murder mysteries.
