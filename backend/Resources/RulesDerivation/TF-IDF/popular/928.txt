This movie was excellent. I saw it many years ago as a child in myCatholic grammar school and still remember it. It is a beautiful movingexperience and is a movie that can be watched by the whole family. Iencourage everyone to see it. We need more movies like this one. Ibelieve I may have seen it again on TV many years ago. I believe peopleof all faiths can enjoy this movie. The story is about innocence andfaith. They also have made a remake of the movie, I believe in 1991. Ihave not seen the remake but, usually there is nothing like theoriginal. So, if they thought the movie was good enough to be remade,you know it has to be good. Watch this movie, I guarantee you will notbe disappointed.
