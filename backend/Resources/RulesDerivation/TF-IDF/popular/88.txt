I\'ve always loved this curio, a z-grade murder mysteryfromproducer Willis Kent (Cocaine Fiends; Reb Russell westerns) setina seedy sideshow arcade with a cavalcade of odd and interestingcarny performers worked into the plot.As a murder mystery, it supplies a number of good red herrings,and the cheap sets and downbeat atmosphere and hard-boileddialogue give the film a raw, exciting feel...The cast is full of reliable veterans, many from the silentera(former silent actors filled the z-grade independent films oftheearly 30s), so that even the smallest role is colorfullyplayed.And star Henry B. Walthall, of Birth of A Nation fame andamajor star in the mid-to-late teens and early twenties(superbin Ibsen\'s Ghosts and also The Scarlet Letter), gives amoving performance as a one-time college professor who hasbeenreduced by tragedy to performing magic tricks in a sideshow.Hegets a number of featured scenes and, as always, has anunderstatedgrace and elegance as an actor (see also the serial TheWhisperingShadow and the feature The Flaming Signal for other films ofhisfrom this period). This was, I believe, his last film, andhisname isn\'t even spelled correctly in the credits (his name isabovethe title!).By the way, trainspotters should note that there are threeversionsof this in circulation--a mail order outlet from Oregonrecentlyreleased a crisp looking copy,but it is missing a scene at thebeginningand has different canned music over the opening credits from anoldcopy I have from a worn 16mm--and the AFI catalog lists anotherversionwith later-filmed exotic dancing footage spliced into thedancing girl scenes.Today\'s "bad boys" of the post-Pulp Fiction cinema world couldtakea lesson in understatement and atmosphere from this film. Hatsoffto director Melville Shyer for another solid piece of work!
