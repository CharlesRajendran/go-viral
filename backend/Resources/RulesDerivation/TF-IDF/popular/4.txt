In the early days of sound Paramount purchased a number of Zene Greystories to be filmed, mostly as B picture attractions and done by theirrising new B picture cowboy, Randolph Scott. Fighting Caravans howevergot the A picture treatment and starred Gary Cooper. Cooper plays a young hell raising scout who's been taught the ways ofthe woods by two grizzled old timers, Ernest Torrence and TullyMarshall. All three of them sign on to guide a wagon train in the 1860swest. Adding to the attraction for Cooper is pretty young Lily Damitawho earlier on pretended to be his wife to get him out of trouble witha sheriff.A lot of the same ground was covered by Twentieth Century Fox the yearbefore with The Big Trail and its new star John Wayne. The Big Trailhowever failed to find its audience, but Fighting Caravans with provedbox office star Cooper showed a respectable profit for Paramount-Publixas the white mountain studio was called at that time. Of course bothfilms owe plenty to James Cruze's silent classic, The Covered Wagon.Like in The Big Trail the villain here is a renegade white man,stirring up the Indians. The very rousing attack on the wagon trainduring the climax had elements of it borrowed over 20 years later inthe James Stewart western, Bend of the River.A whole lot of Gary Cooper's early sound films for some reason arenever shown. Possible that prints no longer exist. Though FightingCaravans is not a great film, it's an entertaining one. In fact a fewyears later it was remade by Randolph Scott in Wagon Wheels where thatfilm used all kinds of stock footage from this one.
