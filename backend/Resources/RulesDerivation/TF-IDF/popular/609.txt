Joel McCrea did another western with a similar premise to The Outridersfor Warner Brothers in South of St. Louis. That was three partners in acattle ranch who all went their separate ways as a result of the CivilWar. Here to the premise is three men who also go their separate ways as aresult of the Civil War. Here the shared experience is prison camp.Joel McCrea, Barry Sullivan, and James Whitmore are Confederateprisoners who escape in early 1865. In effecting their escape they fallinto the hands of a rebel guerrilla leader played by Jeff Corey.Being guerrillas these guys don\'t play by the rules. The trio eithergoes west to Santa Fe to act as Judas goats and lead a gold train intoambush or die right there. Even the always honorable Joel McCrea seeshe has no options here.The rest of the story is how the conflicts internal and external areresolved and how the three escaped prisoners decide what course theyhave to take. Oh, and Joel McCrea meets up with Arlene Dahl and shekind of helps him along in the decision process.The movies never had a more honorable or stalwart hero than JoelMcCrea. And if you\'ve seen any of his films, fans will know thatwhatever he does it will be the honorable thing. It\'s a tribute toMcCrea that if he insisted on always being the stalwart hero, he hadthe talent and personality to carry it off.It\'s familiar ground for Joel McCrea, but western fans will like thestory and the gorgeous technicolor photography that captures it.
