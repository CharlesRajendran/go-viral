Very watchable giallo, which as the English title suggests, wallows innudity and sex (much of it with a seeming wink to the audience).Stylistically and plot-wise, it\'s pretty much giallo-by-numbers, withthe expected camera and editing flourishes and some fairly goodsuspense. There are plenty of point-of-view shots of theheavy-breathing masked killer, shock cuts, lots of red herrings andobscure motivations, etc. However, it\'s the outrageous politicalincorrectness of it all that separates this one from the mainstream --the male characters are all cranky and abusive and the females areeager to shed their duds in response. Certainly a must-see for EdwigeFenech fans, and the fade-out is unbelievably tacky, right out of oneof those low-humour Italian comedies. There\'s also fine score, amixture of funky Bitches-Brew jazz and woo-woo lounge stylings, whichhelps bridge the suspense scenes.
