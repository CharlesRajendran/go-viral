"Terror Is a Man" (1959) is perhaps more well known for its status asthe first Filipino horror film, rather than for its own fine merits.That's a real shame, as it turns out to be an extremely well done takeon H.G. Wells' "The Island of Dr. Moreau," but with unique slants allits own. Here, the marooned sailor is played by the likable RichardDerr (who sci-fi fans may remember from 1951's "When Worlds Collide")and the not-so-mad surgeon/scientist by Francis Lederer. The doctor hasa hotty wife in this version of the story, and she is played by GretaThyssen (Miss Denmark, 1954), shown to good advantage in negligee andbathing suit in several steamy scenes. (She really does put the "thigh"in "Thyssen," lemme tell you!) In addition to uniformly fine,no-nonsense acting, the film boasts beautiful B&W photography (nicelypresented on this clean and crisp-looking DVD), eerie and suspensefulmusic, stylish direction, and a unique-looking monster that isunfortunately (and literally) kept under wraps until the denouement.The film gives us some interesting speculations on just what makes aman a man, and is really quite intelligent and restrained throughout. Awarning bell alerts the audience to a shocking scene (a close-up of asurgical incision) that should gross out only the most squeamish ofviewers. My only problem with this DVD, really, was the fluctuatingsound quality. But that should not deter viewers from checking out thismost interesting horror tale. It's a winner.
