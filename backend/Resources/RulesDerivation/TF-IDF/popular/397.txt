This is one of those films which starts off with a bang, slows downwith a big lull in the middle section, and then finishes strong.Kudos to the special-effects people to make the giant tarantula sceneslook pretty good, even by today's standards some 50 years after thiswas made. Many times, the huge spider looks real while it's crawlingdown the road. I would like to have seen one or two more scenes of itin that middle section which would have kept viewers on edge throughoutthe film. Instead, it got a bit talky in spots.Anyway, it still entertained and it was fun for me to see Leo G.Carroll, a guy I saw each week growing up watching "Topper" ontelevision. Carroll played, by far, the most interesting character inthis movie.The acting was good in here, too, once again above '50s sci-fistandards. It was one of the better entries in the recently-releasedSci-Fi Ultimate DVD set, offered at Best Buy. A pretty good transfer,too.
