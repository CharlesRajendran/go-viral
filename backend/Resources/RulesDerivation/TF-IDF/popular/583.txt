I am a great-niece of Marjorie Lawrence. It's a very sad fact thatMarjorie is best known outside of Australia. However, she was recentlyhonored as one of 100 Australian Entertainers of the Century. It's alsoa bit of a shame that this movie is a Hollywood producer'sinterpretation of an American publisher's version of my Great-Aunt'slife. The real family story is actually much more interesting. AuntieMarj never smoked a cigarette in her life - but it seems everyonesmoked in the movies of the 50s. My mother and my aunt attended theworld premiere here in Melbourne. I remember meeting Auntie Marj as achild in the 70s.
