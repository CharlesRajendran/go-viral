ON WITH THE SHOW (Warner Brothers, 1929), directed by Alan Crosland, isthe studio's contribution to MGM's box office hit, THE Broadway MELODY.Unlike other backstage musicals from that era, this one consists of nodress rehearsals nor pre-show preparations. It skips all that in favorof what's presented on opening night at the Wallace Theater somewherein New Jersey. The opening title card sums it up best, "For weeks, 'ThePhantom Sweetheart' troupe has staggered through the rough tank townstoward distant Broadway Â— It's pathway strewn with unpaid bills.Tonight would tell the tale, Broadway or Bust." And Broadway or Bust itis. In fact, an odd mixture of two stories for the price of one. Thefirst being the behind the scenes plot development revolving around thetheatrical troupe and staff. Instead of the usual unrelated musicalnumbers most commonly found in Hollywood back-stagers, the second storytitled "The Phantom Sweetheart," is set to song and dance on a Southernplantation where a young man (Arthur Lake) falls in love with a veiledgoddess (Betty Compson) prior to his wedding day. Not seen in itsentirety, the stage production is interrupted with inter-cuts of thebackstage story.In spite of Lake and Compson heading the cast, their scenes, along withothers, are secondary. There are no characters who actually dominatethe story from start to finish, but an assortment of those coming inand out whenever their scenes allow. The center of attention reallybelongs to the least likely pair of Jimmy (William Bakewell), the headusher, and his girlfriend, Kitty (Sally O'Neil), a coat room girl, whomJimmy feels has the "stuff" to make it on Broadway After the rise ofthe curtain where the actors perform to a full house, situations occur,all involving money. Jerry (Sam Hardy), the producer, owes Sam Bloom(Purnell B. Pratt) unpaid bills and keeps him from taking back hisscenery or taking what's owed him from the box office cash receipts;Willie Durant (Wheelar Oakman), the show's backer, refuses to guaranteecapital income and later forces himself on Kitty; Harold Astor (Lake),the juvenile leading man in need of cash to give to his mother,constantly bickering about scene stealing with fellow comedian JoeBeaton (Joe E. Brown); and leading lady Nita French (Compson), refusingto continue her performance unless she receives the $400 due her. Thevery moment of her strike, the box office gets held up by a mysteriousfigure holding a gun. All this, and opening night, too, but the showmust go on, Broadway or bust.With score composed by Harry Akst and Grant Clarke, the musical programis as follows: "Welcome Home" (sung by Henry Fink); "Let Me Have MyDreams" (sung by Betty Compson); "Am I Blue?" (sung by Ethel Waters);"Lift the Tulips in Your Two Lips" (sung by Fink and Josephine Houston,danced by the Four Covans); "Let Me Have My Dreams" (reprise byCompson); specialty dance solo number (Joe E. Brown); "In The Land ofLet's Pretend" (sung by chorus); "Don't It Mean a Thing to You" (sungby Josephine Houston and Arthur Lake); "Let Me Have My Dreams" (sung bySally O'Neil); "Birmingham Bertha" (sung by Ethel Waters); "WeddingDay" (sung by Fink, Lake and Houston); and Finale (entire cast).Other members of the cast consist of Louise Fazenda as Sarah Fogerty,an eccentric comedienne who supplies offstage laughter; ThomasJefferson (not the third U.S.President) as "Dad", the stage doorman;Lee Moran and Harry Gribbon as stage hands, Pete and Ike, along withspecialty acts by the Fairbanks Twins and an assortment of blackentertainers highlighted by a Ethel Waters, in her movie debut, takingcenter stage with her fine rendition of the film's most notable song,"Am I Blue?" Her solo effort, along with "Birmingham Bertha" oppositeCharlie Bubbles, both unrelated to the theatrical story, arehighlights, along with a lively but unmemorable score to make up forits dull stretches at the midway point. The staging by Larry Ceballosis adequate, not spectacular, yet steps towards the right directioncompared to 1929 stage musicals consisting of cart wheel dancing andacrobatics.Crosland, who made history directing THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the "firsttalkie," improves with techniques revolving around camera movement withangles taken from different parts of the stage, above and beyond spiralstaircases as chorus girls rush down to meet their curtain call, andsilhouette image of musical conductor in orchestra pit waving his stickin front of the rising curtain or stage performance. What's lacking isfurther use of close-ups of principal players and dancers, somethingthat would be common place in future musicals to come. It's also fungoing back in time watching antiques like this and listening to catchphrases of the day of "Go sit on a tack," or corny dialog recited bySam Hardy, "There are only a few of you sweet kids left," or "Go outand give them everything you got." For 1929, ON WITH THE SHOW madecinema history for being the first musical filmed entirely in color.Current prints that have circulated either in revival theaters of the1970s and 80s, later on cable television (TNT in February 1991 as partof a tribute to Black History Month) and on Turner Classic Movies, arecurrently in black and white. To date, color prints are presumed lost.Fortunately the movie survives, considering how many early talkies havebeen lost due to neglect or decay.Its length of 103 minutes might be a bit long, but I cannot help butfeel its initial theatrical showing was a bit longer considering aslight interruption of the underscoring after the opening cast credits.And now, on with the show.
