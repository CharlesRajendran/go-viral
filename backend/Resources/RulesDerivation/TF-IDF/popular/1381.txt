This is one of the ten best examples of black and white cinematography tocome out of Hollywood - shot after shot superbly composed and withextraordinary use of deep focus, allowing objects and people at a distanceto comment visually on the mid and foreground.   It is a haunting tale ofmorality, license and responsibility.  Dorian is an innocent untilpromptedto experience all avenues of life, good and bad.  His wish to never growoldis a vain one and vanity coupled with self-absorption prompt his downfall.Hatfield gives a quiet, self-contained performance.  Sanders talks far toofast, dropping Wildisms as if he were hurrying through a list of them togetto dinner, and although his Wildean character is important to the plot,onewishes he took more time in his dialogue delivery.   There are mere hintsatGray\'s homosexuality being the core of why he is shunned as a corruptionanda corrupting influence.  Although Lansbury is quite fine as his firstconquest, Sibyl Vane, she is on screen for only a few scenes and in mymind,does not warrant either the Oscar nom nor the Golden Globe win as BestSupporting Actress.   The stunning Art Direction (all classic and empirelines contrasting with the Victorian frou frou elsewhere) deserved itsOscarnom and the brilliant cinematography well deserved its Academy Award.  Thesuperbly atmospheric musical score never insinuates itself, it merelycomments quietly on what is taking place with motif references - it toodeserved Oscar recognition of some sort.   This is a must-see - one of thegreat films - psychologically deep and both dramatically and visuallysumptuous.
