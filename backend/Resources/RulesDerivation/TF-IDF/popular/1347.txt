The other review of this movie got the plot wrong. Thelma Ritter is theMOTHER-IN-LAW of Gene Tierney, not her MOTHER. Ms. Ritter\'s son in thefilm,played by John Lund is the pretentious one. When his mother arrives toattend his wedding to the gently brought up Ms. Tierney, who is actually asweetheart and a lady in the best sense of the word, he hands Thelma somecash to get a makeover, noting that she should especially purchase GLOVES,to hide her hands that have worked hard at a hamburger stand to put himthrough a fancy college. This guy is a real stinker!! Thelma ends up notgoing to the ceremony, fearful she will embarrass her jerk of a son. Shethen gets some jobs to buy a fantastic outfit so she can drop in on thenewlyweds. When Ms. Ritter gets there, Gene Tierney thinks she is the cookshe wanted, and latches on to her because Ms. Tierney is having her firstdinner party, and she is in a state of panic and disaster. The plotrevolvesaround the fact that Thelma stays on to help out, and swears her son tosecrecy about who she is. There are absolutely SOLID GOLD performances byMiriam Hopkins, as Gene\'s snooty mother, and Larry Keating, as John Lund\'sdown-to-earth boss. The best part of this movie is when Gene discovers themasquerade and tells her insensitive husband off, defending his mother asawonderful, honorable woman. DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE !!
