I came across this unheralded early William Dieterle film a while back andit blew me away. Quite an astonishing film for a 1931. I believe it wasDieterle\'s first Hollywood outing. It\'s a "Sun Also Rises"-like story ofseveral ex-WWI American fliers living, relaxing and drinking in Paris andthe wacky, free-spirited woman they "adopt" into their group. A trulyunusual film--the dialogue is almost entirely in non sequitors which givesit an almost ahead-of-its time feel. The editing and the frenetic energy ofit all are spectacular. It offers an accurate and immediate picture ofpost-war disillusionment of its time, the confused emotional/psychologicalstate of the characters, much the same way Henry King\'s 1957 "Sun AlsoRises" captured 1950s post-WWII mentality.Dieterle is a talented stylist, and it shows all the way through, usingfast-moving and inventive camera work. And it\'s beautifully photographed inthat "German-looking" Expressionism early-1930s style.The performances are top-notch. Richard Barthelmess is excellent as CaryLockwood. Helen Chandler is quite distinctive as the leading lady Nikki. AndI especially like David Manners in this film. He\'s one of the forgottenleading men of the 30s. Manners is best known today for his appearances inthe Universal horror films, but he made a wide range of films--one of myfavorites is his scrupulous secretary in love with a glamorous Kay Francisin Dieterle\'s other unheralded classic of the early 30s, "ManWanted."
