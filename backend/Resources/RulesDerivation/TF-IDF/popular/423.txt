This Basil Rathbone-Sherlock Holmes adventure involves a bunch ofsuspects on a train, each looking guilty making the viewer undecidedwho really is the culprit who trying to steal a precious diamond, "TheStar Of Rhodesia."With all these suspects (who are fun to watch), there a number oftwists every five minutes to keep us all guessing. There isn't a lot ofaction, but just enough to keep things lively. Once again Nigel Bruceas "Dr. Watson," provides the humor with his mumbling and bumblingaboard the train. It's always fun to see the equally-bumbling InspectorLestrade, (Dennis Hoey) too.What I really appreciated was the fine transfer the UCLA 35mm"restored" process team did on this disc. It looks great. Speaking oflooks, there is a very attractive woman aboard, Rene Godfrey, but shemust have gotten the part because of those looks because she's not muchof an actress. It didn't matter; she didn't have a lot of lines. Thewrap-up at the end went a little quickly but overall I have nocomplaints about this Holmes entry. I would watch it multiple times andalways enjoy it.
