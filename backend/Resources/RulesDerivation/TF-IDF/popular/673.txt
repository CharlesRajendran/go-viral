This little sentimental tale is so sweet and heartwarming, I considerit one of my favorite holiday movies. The beginning is a bit slow, thecourtroom scene drawn out and ones mind can wander. But once the storybegins, it carries viewers back to a time when simpler pleasures whereenjoyed. The popcorn, singing around the piano, simple gifts, popovers,canary in the cage, white elephant sale and barn dance all make onelong for those days. Who wouldn't like to step into this movie, and gohome with John/Jack, snuggle in the flannel gown, in the cozy bed, andhave the Mom and Aunt fussing around, seeing to your every need. I givethis movie a 10 and believe it is one of the "overlooked" films of theholiday season. I am a great fan of the classics, Miracle on 34th,Wonderful Life, White Christmas and Christmas in Conneticut. But thesesmaller, lesser known films, are simply grand. Holiday Affair isanother to check out, if you want some variety in your viewing.
