I can\'t add much to the raves already posted. The first song I remember my mother singing to me was "Smiling Through"("But through all the long years, when the clouds brought their tears,those two eyes of blue came smiling through at me"), and she\'d tell methe movie\'s story. I taught the song to my children and grandchildren,but until recent years there was no way to get a copy of the movie.I thought I wanted the Jeannette MacDonald version because of herbeautiful voice, but it was back ordered and only this one wasavailable--lucky for me. It seems to be everyone\'s favorite of thethree.The wedding scene is a masterpiece--understated and heartbreaking, butI\'m finally able to handle it. It\'s that very last scene that gets meevery time. Best kind of tears, though: the kind you\'re "smilingthrough".Norma Shearer, like Irene Dunne, is not only beautiful to look at butirresistibly likable.
