Not to be confused with "The Ghost Ship," one of four (!) classic ValLewton films from 1943, OR the 2002 horror fest "Ghost Ship," 1952's"Ghost Ship" is an obscure little British picture that should justmanage to please. In it, real-life husband and wife Dermot Walsh andHazel Court play Guy and Margaret Thornton, a Canadian couple living inEngland, who buy the Cyclops, a 40-year-old steamer yacht, and realize,after a series of freakish incidents, that the darn thing really mightbe haunted. An aged biddy of a medium (a pale knockoff of the marvelouscharacter brought to indelible life by Margaret Rutherford in 1945's"Blithe Spirit") holds a seance on board and, via a series offlashbacks, the viewer is allowed to witness the events that led to theship's current state, culminating in a surprise ending of sorts. Afast-paced 72 minutes, "Ghost Ship"'s major lure for modern-dayaudiences is perhaps Hazel Court, who over the next 10 years wouldbecome one of British cinema's reigning queens of horror. With aperfectly shaped mouth that might make Angelina Jolie envious and apair of zygomatic bones that could turn Deborah Harry green with envy,Hazel was indeed luscious to look at on screen, especially in thisrelatively early role; sadly, her striking red hair and green eyescannot be appreciated in this B&W film. The picture in question is alighthearted affair that is not a bit scary (even an initial glimpse ofthe ship's ghost fails to raise any hackles) but always engaging,thanks to some pleasant performances, a crackling, no-nonsense scriptfrom director Vernon Sewell, and a sprightly score by Eric Spear. Inall, a minor affair, but an entertaining one, presented here on asurprisingly crisp-looking DVD courtesy of Wham! USA.
