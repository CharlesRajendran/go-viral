I suppose that any novel that's as much of a downer as Moby Dick wouldnot find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough oftheir own troubles. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melvillenovel is a pure coincidence. In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it,not that too much of it was kept for the film. We first meet AhabCreely (he's got a last name and a brother) as one happy go lucky soulwith two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett who is FatherMapple's daughter. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, alsowants to marry Bennett.John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance. Barrymore hadnot quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silentera histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the raftersof any movie theater this film was playing in.We see Ahab lose his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to saythe amputation scene was pretty gruesome. Of course this was all beforethe Code. Still I'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered.After that the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale that he thinks madehim unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. That is not exactly Melville'smotivation, in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as hewrote it.One of the things Melville did was invest the crew of Ahab's ship thePequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpoonerthe names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbsmight as well be Smith and Jones.I'd see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothingelse.
