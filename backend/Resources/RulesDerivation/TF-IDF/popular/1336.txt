I have seen most versions of Treasure Island. This is one of myfavorites. Not what I would call erotic in any shape or form. GoodBeery and Coogan vehicle with plenty of pirates and treasure hunting asother versions. The story line is not much different than any other. Itseems a bit brighter and more lighthearted. Although none are very trueto the story this one is a decent adaptation of the Robert LouisStevenson book. I happen to like the casting of Lionel Barrymore, OttoKruger, Lewis Stone, and Nigel Bruce in this gem. Their defense of theIsland Stockade is exciting. It has more replayability than all but acouple. It is great fun for the whole family for a lazy afternoon. Anotch above most except perhaps the one with Charlton Heston. Icertainly hope to see this on DVD since I would add it to mycollection.
