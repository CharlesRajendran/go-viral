Where do I start, this seems to be just a well done ensemble farce withelements of screwball comedy. Mistaken identity, overbearing mother inlaw. But when you take a second look, this is a movie with cynicalundercurrents about the American dream. I don't want to give away theplot so I will just comment on the excellent cast and direction byMitchell Leisen. Leisen treats the material with such respect and care,what could have been average is fresh and new. Gene Tierney has a greatcomic touch, Miriam Hopkins gives a great over the top performance,then what can I say Thelma Ritter, just amazing. I was really impressedwith her warm hearted scenes with Gene Tierney. There is not a weaklink in the supporting cast. This is great ensemble acting. The moviecomes to a very satisfying conclusion. This is one of the mostunderrated comedies of the era. I do believe this movies is gaining therespect it deserves. Most critics today consider this a CLASSIC. I hopeParamount will release this on DVD.
