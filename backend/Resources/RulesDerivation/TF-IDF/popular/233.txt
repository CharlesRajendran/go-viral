"The Letter" is an absolutely fascinating early talkie. The onlysurviving talkie made by the legendary stage actress, Jeanne Eagels(whose skill as a Broadway stage actress was obvious in the delivery ofher lines - particularly the final scene, which I found mesmerizing)cries out for a restoration! The print of the film I viewed had a verypoor visual quality (although I could always discern the action), butbecame all the more tantalizing - this film probably looked great in1929, and would still look wonderful in a refurbished print. For a veryearly "talkie", I was very surprised at how natural and "unstodgy" thedialogue is (and the soundtrack was remarkably clear and strong, witheven a little bit of profanity, which I'm sure it raised a few eyebrowsin 1929!) It is very unfortunate that Eagels' other talkie "Jealousy"is now lost, and all the more reason that "The Letter" (being the onlysound document of this legendary actress) should have a widerdistribution. I hope someone some day will spearhead such anundertaking. A 2011 update: I recently acquired the DVD release of "The Letter" fromWarner Archives. It is a revelation - an amazingly good print,particularly considering it is mastered from what is apparently thesole surviving 35mm print. Some segments lack musical background, butthe dialogue is intact, and the visuals are far better than I expected(or hoped for!). Congratulations and many thanks to Warner Archives forfinally making this treasure available!
