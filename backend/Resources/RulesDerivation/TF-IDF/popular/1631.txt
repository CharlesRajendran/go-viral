Four former flying aces, scarred both physically & emotionally, makeTHE LAST FLIGHT through the bars of Paris & Lisbon with an eccentricAmerican girl.Well-crafted & poignant, this film tells the sad tale of American WorldWar One buddies whose lives are essentially over with the cessation ofthe conflict. Aimless & drifting, but seemingly very well financed,they stagger from bar to bar, looking for the forgetfulness that comeswith drunken oblivion. If not for the noble loyalty they feel for eachother their story, and the sundering of their quartet, would be almostunremittingly lugubrious.Director William Dieterle was given fine service by his cast: silentscreen star Richard Barthelmess, leader of the band, as a pilotsensitive about his burned hands; gunner David Manners dealing with anervous tic in his left eye; country boy Johnny Mack Brown letting highjinks and alcohol define his new existence; and sharpshooter ElliottNugent, shell-shocked into extreme lethargy.Helen Chandler is remarkable as the highly unusual young woman who isallowed to become an essential part of the fliers' lives. Her kookyvagueness and affection for pet turtles is most endearing. Walter Byrongives an effective performance as a caustic reporter who tags alongwith the others for his own motives.*************************At one point in the story Mr. Barthelmess & Miss Chandler visit thecemetery of Père-Lachaise in Paris, where he tells her something of thehistory of the tragic lovers Pierre Abélard (1079-1142) and Héloïse(1098-1164), who lie interred there. Barthelmess mentions the terriblerevenge visited upon Abélard by the Canon Fulbert, the uncle ofHéloïse, without actually saying what it was. Even with Pre-Codeliberality, forced castration was not a subject to be broached lightly.
