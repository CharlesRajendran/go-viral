What a remarkably entertaining little film loosely based on the life ofsilent screen star Pearl White. Betty Hutton gives a lively, sympatheticperformance. John Lund is the aloof unemotional object of Pearl\'saffections. Frank Loesser\'s score is beautiful. Especially the movie\'sthemesong \'I Wish I Didn\'t Love You So\' which Betty performs sotenderly.This movie deserves mention as a classic. If you get a chance have a lookat it. It is fast paced but there time in places for a little fun andsentiment.
