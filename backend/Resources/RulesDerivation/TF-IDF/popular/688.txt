This film has to be on the short list offilms-that-epitomize-pre-code-Hollywood. Adultery, drugs, crime,flaunting of morals and convention, free-spirit thumbing their nose,all done with humour and glamour. One can understand why the church wasupset! Problem was that there were many films that played on thesethemes so it must have seemed that Hollywood was really out to corruptthe world. This one has the full package but with a wink and smoothnessthat today's garbage film-makers would never have the patience topull-off. Too bad the code swung the pendulum way too far in the otherdirection. A must-see for Francis and Powell fans.
