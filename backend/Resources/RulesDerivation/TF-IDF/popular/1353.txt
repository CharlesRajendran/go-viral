This was a film I enjoyed from the beginning of this right to the endbecause of the funny story and the outstanding cast of great actors.Gene Tierney,( Maggie McNulty), "The Left Hand of God" meets John Lund,(Val McNulty), "Steel Town" and marries him immediately and has nevereven met his mother. Val McNulty's mother is Thelma Ritter, (EllenMcNulty), "Pillow Talk", who has a hamburger stand in Jersey City, NewJersey and is running into problems with her business and has to sellher hamburger stand and decides to pack up and visit her son. Ellenarrives at her daughter-in-law's apartment and gets mistaken as a cookwho they are seeking to hire for a big party they are going to arrange.It is from this point in the picture that things start to get rathercrazy where two mother-in-laws are living with the newlyweds and notrealizing that the cook is Val's mother. This is a great 1951 Classiccomedy with two great actresses Gene Tierney and Thelma Ritter. Don'tmiss this film, it is lots of fun to view.
