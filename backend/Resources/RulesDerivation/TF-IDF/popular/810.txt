For some reason Night and the City doesn\'t seem to the credit itdeserves; possibly because it was director Jules Dassin\'s last Americanfilm before being blacklisted as a Communist. I wasn\'t born until theCold War was winding down, but it seems that with movies like Night andthe City to his credit, we could have turned a blind eye even if hereally was a Commie.Honestly this film deserves to rank up there with the likes of TheMaltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, or Out of the Past. The scenes of our"hero" Harry Fabian (Richard Widmark, at his best) being chased throughLondon\'s East End are as starkly beautiful as anything you\'ll ever seeon film. For several minutes there isn\'t a single shade of gray,everything is literally black or white and the camera itself seems tohave joined in hunting Harry. Then there\'s the long, semi-grotesquewrestling scene that took me totally by surprise, it\'s like somethingout of Fellini.Widmark is utterly believable as Fabian, a charming two-bit grifter whoworks as a "club tout" but hatches one ill-fated get-rich-quick schemeafter another. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, there isn\'t acardboard character in the bunch, except maybe Harry\'s girl Marry (GeneTierney) though its really more a flaw in the character than theactress. Mary\'s saintliness may be the writers\' only slip-up though,every other character has the sort of depth that makes the film a joyto watch. They inexorably follow their own motivations, which, ofcourse, rely on those of someone else, who inevitably has a goal of hisor her own, which will eventually derail the plan of someone whomsomeone else is counting on (actually, the film is a little lesstwisted than this review ;-) Criterion has just (2/05) recentlyreleased Night and the City and never has the phrase "filmed inglorious black and white" been more appropriate. Before this filmseemed to lurk in the shadows of AMC or TCM, only occasionally showingits face, as if it were one of the genre\'s minor works. Now, if youhaven\'t seen it you have no excuse, and you\'re only hurting yourself.
