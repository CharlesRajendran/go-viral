I saw this movie as a kid of 10 in Port Arthur, Texas, which had fourtheaters in a four block area. I don't remember all the details, but itwas definitely a feel-good film. The protagonist was an EasternEuropean immigrant whose name was long and hard to pronounce, so he wasre-christened Steve Dangos. Steve first got a job iron ore in an "op'mpit". Being bright and ambitious, he later became an automobilemanufacturer and, if the movie is to be believed, was the first tobuild an enclosed sedan. He was proud to be an American (this was at apoint in World War II when the outcome was expected but not guaranteed)and he named his sons after Washington and Theodore Roosevelt. He hadhis share of sorrow when one of the sons was killed in World War I.This was not one of the all-time film classics, but it must have made agreat impression on me for the basic plot to have stayed with me forall these 62 years.
