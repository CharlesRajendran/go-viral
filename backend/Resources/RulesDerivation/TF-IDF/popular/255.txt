I just can\'t tell you how much I adore this film! It was superb in everyway! Norma Shearer and Fredric March were wonderful together, the chemistrybetween these two can be felt, it burns right through the tv screen! I\'mnotkidding! ;-) It\'s just lovely, you care about these two, you want them tobetogether and be happy! That\'s a sign of good acting on their parts! LeslieHoward is excellent too, don\'t get me wrong. He just can\'t beat Fred! OhFred Fred Fred! Yes, I like him! Is it obvious? ;-) He\'s just the mostamazing actor! I\'m definitely going to buy The Barretts of Wimpole Streetnow because I think anything with Shearer and March together is worth mymoney! Or someone elses! ;-)Oh, and Fred and Norma kiss an awful lot too!Lucky gal! haha!
