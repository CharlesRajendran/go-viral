"The Bribe" is one of the forties film noir entries, and I love it! Topstars of the era include Robert Taylor, Ava Gardner, Charles Laughton,and Vincent Price. It is a story of an honest cop, Rigby played withremarkable insight, by Robert Taylor, who falls in love with a suspect(Ava Gardner), and can\'t make up his mind on if she is guilty orinnocent. John Hodiak is the husband, who is a former fly boy turnedcrook. Charles Laughton is at his sinister best as the "pie shaped man"who is hired by Vincent Price to pay off Rigby. Laughton dogs Rigby,knowing that he is in love with Gardner, till he caves in and decidesto take a bribe to save his love. As in many film noir, only Taylor\'slast name is used, we never know Rigby\'s first name, interesting.Taylor is very convincing as a man torn between love and honor. He isso conflicted, that you feel sorry for him, wishing that Ava would justrun away with him before he turns crook himself. She drugs him andmakes sure he can\'t stop the crooks, but he recovers, and confrontsher, not realizing the trouble she is in herself. In the end, love andhonor conquer all. There is a spectacular fireworks ending, that isreminiscent of "Ride the Pink Horse." All in all the love scenes aresincere, probably because Taylor and Gardner were having an affair atthe time of filming, despite the fact that Taylor was very married toBarbara Stanwyck. Quintessential film noir.
