Jeanne Eagels is brilliant in this short version of THE LETTER. My copyis lousy but I stuck with it because Eagels gives an amazing, Oscarnominated performance that keeps you riveted to the screen. I can onlyimage the power this woman had on stage.The story is the same as the Bette Davis version, but the narrativestructure is all different. Eagels has two fabulous scenes: the trialand the finale. Her English accent slips a couple times but for a 1929movie (and her talkie debut) it's a terrific performance as the amoralLeslie Crosbie.Herbert Marshall, O.P. Heggie, and Reginald Owen co-star. But the filmbelongs to Miss Eagels. If only her follow-up and final film JEALOUSYcould be found!
