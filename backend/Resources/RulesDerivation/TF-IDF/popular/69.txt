I initially went to the Film Forum\'s presentation to experience whatgoing to the movies might have been like 80 years ago. To have anexperience like my grandmother had (she used to rave about HaroldLoyd). I thought the film was going to be OK. I was astonished at thewit of the film, its emotional content and the joy it brought to theaudience. The gags were plentiful and quite clever, the action kepteverything moving and the audience enjoyed themselves immensely(obviously a self selected group). The entire experience was enhancedby a live piano player and I think by the communal experience of seeingthis film at the movies.I highly recommend the film.
