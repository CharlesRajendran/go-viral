I just like the movie.  The first time I saw it was in 1948 and I did notsee it again until a  few years ago when AMC and the History channel startedto show it again.  I watch it every chance I get.  The cast is excellentwith many of the actors becoming more popular in later years. This movieoffers excellent insight into what makes people tick. The platoon making itsway inland during the invasion of Italy offers insight into what a farmer,school teacher, etc. considers important in life.  One scene which I believedescribes the futility of war is where the farmer determines that the soilis worthless.  The cerebral fellow (John Ireland) states simply that it isbecause too many soilders have walked over it for too many years(centuries).I especially like how John Ireland "writes letters" in his head and hopes towrite them on paper later.  I also like the part where Lloyd Bridges startslaughing because he suddenly feels like a little kid when plantingexplosives on a bridge. The confident Sergeant ( Dana Andrews)  shows fearwhen about to give the command to launch the attack on thefarmhouse.The fast talking dialogue between Richard Conte and his buddy remind me ofpeople we have met.  This is an excellent movie.I believe that most people would appreciate this movie, whether or not theywatch war movies.  This movie offers a lot of insight into humannature.The movie is practically void of blood and gore and leaves it to theimagination of the viewer, such as when the Lieutenant is seriously woundedwhile on board the landing craft, with half of  his face missing.  You canimagine it and don\'t have to see it.
