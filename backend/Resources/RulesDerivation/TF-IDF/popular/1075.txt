At the time of writing, the anti-80s sentiment that was so strongparticularly in the 90s has more or less disappeared. Finally, we canagain appreciate this strange decade's fashion. Miami Vice wascutting-edge, the coolest of the coolest, and a must-see for thosefascinated by 80s aesthetics. Some of the episodes are actually slowand contemplative, focusing much more on building a cool atmosphererather than on endless action scenes. Somehow, it captures much of theoptimistic "no problem" attitude of the decade that has recently beendismissed as "kitsch". At least, this is the case for the first coupleof seasons. The speculative elements that at the time raised somecriticism look innocent and almost charming compared to what's beingshown today. You can see cool design, cool clothes, cool architecture,cool attitudes, cool cars, cool boats, listen to cool music. Though onemay like or dislike the style, everyone will see that there has beenput quite an enormous effort into all this. As for the stories, theyfit the spirit of the series quite well - they're interesting enough tocatch your interest - never complex, but not devoid of intriguing andwell-developed characters. This is simply one of the best showcases forwhat the 80s were all about.
