I watched the tape I had made on 4/18/02 again today and read over some ofthe comments that have been made on this old curio and I felt the need toadd a few more observations of my own.-\tFirstly, I enjoy watching old films. I see them not as competitors withcurrent entertainment but as portholes into the past. I see the past as aseries of presents and the present as living history that we are privilegedto witness. Old films allow us to `look\' at past era, such as 1929, upclose. Each era contains its classics, such as this same year\'s `All Quieton the Western Front\', that are so good that they are timeless. But most ofwhat was created was material such as Hollywood Review of 1929, designed toprovide entertainment for the masses, to the tastes of the age. These peoplewere not making this film to entertain us but rather to entertain theaudiences of 1929. They must have done a good job, as this was a big hit.There is plenty of material being produced today that will look just assilly to future generations. Some of it looks pretty silly right now. -\tKeep in mind that while the cinema was three decades old at this time,sound recording was an infant. Not only do we hear the `clumpclumpclump ofthe dancer\'s feet but the limitations imposed on the camera by the newtechnology had stripped a generation of innovations from the medium and whatwe have is a very flat rendering of a stage review. In time, Hollywood wouldrediscover how to make films- essentially they filmed much of them insilence and added what sounds they wished us to hear afterwards. We couldhear the tap of Fred Astaire\'s shoes but the clump of the dancer\'s feetwould be muted. The songs would be dubbed in under controlled conditions ina studio. The same presentation would have been done a lot better just a fewyears later. But this is the best that could be done in1929.-\tIn the wake of the development of sound, Hollywood rushed out movies thatexploited the new technology as fast as they could, (this one was puttogether in 28 days), just as a lot of films today use computer generatedmonsters, armies, cliffs, etc., just to show off what they can do. We haveto remember what a miracle watching movies stars talk must have seemed likeat the time. Whenever a technical process becomes a drawing card in itself,other aspects of the movies are going to suffer- just as today we see manymovies designed simply to show off computer technology that neglect tocreate human characters we can relate to or tell a coherent plot. I\'m notsure I wouldn\'t rather see `Hollywood Revue of 1929\' again than to see `VanHelsing\' again. I wonder what the cast of the first would have thought ofthe second. They might have liked their product a little better.-\tIt was decided that the best way to exploit the new medium was to producemusicals. Talking was fine but people wanted to hear music, as well. Andsinging and dancing filled the bill. But the people who had become silentmovie stars were not necessarily talented musical performers. Joan Crawfordwas a chorus girl but that\'s a long way from being a lead singer or dancer. Imagine modern Hollywood putting on a show like this- with Tom Cruiseplaying comic foil to some Saturday Night Live types and Julia Robertsdancing and singing. Would it come out any better? It\'s best not to be too critical and just look through the crystal ball ofthe TV at the year nineteen hundred and twenty nine, up close and personal.
