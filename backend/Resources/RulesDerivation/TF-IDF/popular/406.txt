My youngest sister and I have a tradition of watching old movies that areset in older times. "Jason and the Argonauts" was classic; she\'s youngenoughto get scared by the realistic effects of present day, so the specialeffects in these movies just makes her--and I--laugh. But this movie wasdifferent. It was low on the special effects, which 86ed our tradition, butwe had fun watching it all the same. It was enjoyable and funny, with aneasy plot to follow (which always helps when one watches a movie with aseven-year-old).If you want my advice, watch it. You\'ll be entertained, even if the sameidea was copied 10,000 times.
