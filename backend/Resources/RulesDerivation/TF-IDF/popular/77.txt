This wonderful 1952 film - it must have been approaching Humphrey'slast performance - wins on all levels.It triumphs as an historical curiosity into how newspapers werepublished 50 years ago, down to the presses and the layouts andassignments, and also for its truly remarkable supporting cast, many ofthem, some famous, like Ethel Barrymore, Jim Backus and Ed Begley andsome part of the Hollywood backdrops in score of movies.Kim Hunter excels also as the Bogart ex. Martin Gabel eerily predictsthe Tony Soprano performance of today as an underworld Kingpin shownwith his perfect domestic arrangement.The scene of the "wake" for the death of the newspaper is wonderful,and also some wonderful camera pans on continuous action in manyscenes.The script is well done and keeps the action moving along, some funnythrowaway lines too, particularly in the car scene with the mobster andin his ex-wife's bedroom.Also it is subtle and understated and not rampant with the 2X4's ofsome of today's instant-soup scripts. Do not miss this one, Bogie andKim fans!!8 out of 10.
