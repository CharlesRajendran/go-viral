This is a little gem for those wanting a bit of relaxed entertainment.Unfortunately it came in a period when Kelly/Donen were setting a newstandard for big production and very rapid pacing, so it was out offashion and ignored. Everyone is charming; Marge and Gower Champion areat their peak, Bob Fosse is just hitting his stride (amusing that hisscreen persona was so charmingly little-boyish, in contrast to the darkangular sexiness of his later stage choreographies), and DebbieReynolds is pixie-ish as ever. Helen Wood was not a great actress, butshe was necessary to provide an additional dance flavor (see below).To differ from another reviewer, I think that Kurt Kaznar was perfectfor the Leo Belney part, at least as it was written. He carries offbeing totally suggestible, changing opinion instantly, and having anequal conviction in each new attitude.Though they don\'t make a big deal about it, the film was mirroring areal conundrum facing Broadway directors at that period: what kind ofdance to use? Tap was still around but on its way out; a kind ofjazz-ballet blend was becoming mainstream; the avant-garde was a moredramatic and angular "modern" dance. Which would the public go for inthe next show?
