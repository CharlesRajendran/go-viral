Grand film, has all the elements of a greek tragedy with a socko ending.And all ends honorably.  A definite 10. Story plot, character developmentand even the scenery.  From a dance-hall to the railroad yards to a bridgeunder siege by flood.  And Jimmy Cagney dances!  How could you go wrong.Dialogue a bit \'racy\' in spots.
