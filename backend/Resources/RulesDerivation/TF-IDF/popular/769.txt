I thought the movie had the "feel" of western life..the cattle grazingin the opener..the dust on the outfits (except Johnny\'s!)You could evensee the dust flying in several scenes....good characters, except theforeman (just didn\'t fit)..Ellison excellent as Johnny..and Hayes,McGlynn as Red and Middleton as Buck--all good...how about the scenewhere Hoppy appears riding Topper (I guess it was Topper,then) downthat steep hill? I like the silent film "leftovers", like Hoppy\'ssteely glare and the gathering of the ranchers scene near theend...Just a very well-done, enjoyable film! This movie borrows plotelements from the book Hopalong Cassidy (1910)-- Meeker, the H2 spread,Thunder Mesa..to name a few. I\'m still reading the book, so I don\'tknow all the details..! Interesting note-- the two well-known westerncharacter actors--Boyd and Hayes-- are from Eastern locales: Marion,Ohio and Wellsville, NY, respectively. Once again--a top rating forthis film!
