"Imitation of Life", the 1934 version, reflected the attitude in thecountry toward blacks. This movie wouldn\'t have had a chance of beingmade in the present climate of political correctness. This movie showshow Hollywood dealt with the racial issues back in those years. JohnStahl directed the film, which stands in stark contrast with theDouglas Sirk\'s take in 1959 which presents a glossier vision of theFanny Hurst novel, in which it\'s based.Between the two versions, this one seems to make more sense, in spiteof the incredible jump from rags to riches Bea Pullman experiences.Claudette Colbert makes Bea more accessible to us, in contrast withLana Turner\'s blonde goddess looks. This Bea Pullman is easier to takebecause the way she makes her money by going into business,capitalizing on Delilah\'s idea about the marketing the perfect blendfor pancakes.Warren William plays Steve Archer, the man who falls in love with Beawhile not suspecting the effect he causes in young Jessie, Bea\'sdaughter. Louise Beavers is Delilah; she is made to speak brokenEnglish to show her ignorance, which was the thing expected every timeblack characters were shown in movies of that period. Ms. Beavers\' rolewas made bigger in the 1959 remake, but Juanita Moore, who played thepart, was not subjected to her predecessor\'s fate. Rochelle Hudson, NedSparks and Fredi Washington round up the supporting cast.
