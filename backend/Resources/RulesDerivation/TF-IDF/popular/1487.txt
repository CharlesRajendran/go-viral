This is the first of three films that Oliver and Gleason made together asteacher Miss Withers and Inspector Piper. It is also the best, thoughMurderon the Blackboard is also top notch. The series continued without Oliver,but not at the same level. The dialogue is witty, prim, sarcastic andsometimes even suggestive. Gleason and Oliver have a fabulous chemistry,thelikes of which would never been seen today, due to casting decisions thathave more to do with pretty faces that acting talent and intelligence. Ifyou like early talkie mysteries, this one will satisfyanytime.
