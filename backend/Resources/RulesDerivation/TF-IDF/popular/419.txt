The good old Mikhalkov-Adabashian-Lebeshev trio means that you get expert -and a bit Western- directing, masterly done design and great camerawork. Thecast is superb. There is a great deal of suspense in this movie although thecounter-espionage is a mere backdrop for a more reflective look at humannature during the trials and tribulations of love and war.
