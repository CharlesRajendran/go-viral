I like that Clark Gable plays the logical extension of the charactershe so often played in the 1930s and 40s. So often he played the likablerogue who made his living just skirting the border between good andevil--playing gamblers, mercenaries or con-men. However, in each filmyou almost never see what this same character would have been like hadthe film followed him into mid-life. Well, ANY NUMBER CAN PLAY is sucha film. Gable plays an older rogue who owns a gambling house but alsohas a wife and older son. And, instead of being firmly in control ofhis life, you can see it slowly crumbling--at least around the edges.This role took some guts to play as he was more vulnerable and GableCOULD have just continued playing "fluff roles". Give it a try and seean adult drama.
