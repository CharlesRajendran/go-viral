Thelma Ritter as down-on-her-luck Ellen McNulty shines in the role of amother-in-law mistaken for a maid. Ellen McNulty is a woman everyonewould want to have on her side, but woe betide anyone who tries to foolher. Thelma gets the best lines, but all parts are well-written and thefilm\'s pacing is superb.The always reliable, always theatrical, Miriam Hopkins, hams it up as asuperficial socialite disappointed in her daughter\'s selection of thedown-to-earth Val McNulty, an up-and- coming corporate man. When anewlywed couple and two mothers occupy the same apartment, watch out! Part of the pleasure of watching a black and white film from the earlyfifties is the setting. The outfits, cars, decor (check out theapartment\'s wallpaper: just amazing in its boldness!) add to the film\'ssubstance. The romantic resolutions at the end of the film are satisfying, andmake sense, not always a feature of light romantic comedies.
