I dare anyone to sit through this film with dry eyes! Especially peopleof the male persuasion. There is simply no way it can be done.Young teen Freddie Bartholomew is a snotty, spoilt brat, and on acruise with his dad he falls overboard and is rescued by Portuguesefisherman Spencer Tracy who takes him to Captain Lionel Barrymore\'scommercial fishing ship. They can\'t afford to go give up their fishingto take the arrogant kid back to land, and so Freddie is forced tospend three months with the crew, gradually mellowing into a nice boyand evolving into a rugged, no-nonsense kid who dotes on Tracy\'s roughand ready Manuel.Victor Fleming was never the most subtle of directors, and thisadaptation of Kipling\'s story does not thrive on its wealth of detailor the ambiguity of emotion, but its sweep is epic and its heart soreal that you feel you have been on a roller-coaster-ride. I loved thereels of the men fishing and preparing the fish, it had a nicedocumentary feel to it, akin to the silent \'Down to the Sea in Ships\'that \'Captains Courageous\' resembles a lot at times. The cinematographyis beautiful, the mist and fog captured with finesse.But this film is all about acting. Spencer Tracy got an Oscar for hisacting as Manuel, cast against type. And although his performanceverges on the sentimental, it never actually tips over. But the filmbelongs to Freddie Bartholomew who surely must have been tempted tooverboard with emotion, but, miraculously, never does. This boy was anastute and intuitive actor, and he never sets a foot wrong. MickeyRooney shines in an itsy bitsy part as the captain\'s son. He nevertries to steal any scenes from Bartholomew (as one suspects he might,and could!), but concentrates on a brisk, matter-of-fact performance ofthis young pro of the sea, every movement he makes seems exactly right,again almost documentary-like.Watch this film if you get the chance. They don\'t come much better, andyes, it will make you bawl and sob. Be warned.
