Call \'Since You Went Away\' schmaltzy, cliched, idealized, propaganda, soapy- whatever you like: I LOVE this movie. It was made when we called themmovies, not films, not cinema.Every Christmastime I HAVE to watch \'Since You Went Away\'. The laughter -that good, clean kind of fun laughter that gets trashed nowadays by the manywho like to affect "sophisticated" jadedness - it provokes from my heart,and the tears it pulls from my eyes are worth every second of this Selznickmasterpiece (in my opinion this movie trumps the overblown, talky,overpraised \'Gone With The Wind\').I laugh and cry, especially, watching and listening to the gifted, lovelyHattie McDaniel handling her role, a good measure of which was written inthe period\'s typical "Negro dialect," with dignity and aplomb. If I had tobe stranded on a desert island with one person I\'d hope it could beMcDaniel, a woman who embodied grace under pressure.Claudette Colbert simply glows throughout. Jennifer Jones oozes smolderingsexuality, but manages to convince us that she\'s a teen verging onresponsible adulthood. Shirley Temple tugs at your heartstrings. McDanielradiates strength, stamina, and tenderness. Monty Woolley irritates andcharms. Joseph Cotten brings a healthy dose of class and charm. AgnesMoorehead infuriates - she was one of the most talented actresses ever tograce the screen. Robert Walker exemplifies the innocence that war guts fromthe young, and the sacrifice made, like his character, by thousands of youngpeople in defending, and assuring the legacy, of America\'s foundingideals.Have your tissues - a whole box - handy. And let \'Since You Went Away\' makeyour heart soar.
