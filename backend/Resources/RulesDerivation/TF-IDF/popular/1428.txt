India - the 1890's - the North-West Frontier. Precocious youngPriscilla arrives with her widowed mother to live with the grandfatherthey've never met, a stern old Army Colonel. Gaining the nickname ofPrivate WEE WILLIE WINKIE, the little girl quickly charms nearlyeveryone around her, including a tough Scots Sergeant. But it is herinfluence with the local bandit chief that portends the greatest impacton all their lives.This was arguably Shirley Temple's finest film. It is certainly hermost lavish. Fox & director John Ford fashioned a mini-epic with greatatmosphere and much to please family viewers. The detailed sets & hugecast of extras do the picture proud.Shirley is wonderful, as usual, in her own unique way, but this timeshe has a couple of co-stars that can hold their own with her. VictorMcLaglen is every inch the embodiment of a bluff British sergeant - andwell he should, given his real-life background as a boxing champion andProvost Marshal of Baghdad. Gruff & tender by turns, he gives anunforgettable performance. As Shirley's grandfather, marvelous old SirC. Aubrey Smith gives another sterling portrayal as the archetype ofthe colonial officer class - crusty & domineering.The rest of the cast is equally enjoyable: Cesar Romero as thechieftain; June Lang & Michael Whalen as Shirley's mother and her newlieutenant friend (fortunately their romance is unobtrusive); WillieFung as the giggling, treacherous house boy; and Constance Collier asthe waspish wife of a brigade officer.
