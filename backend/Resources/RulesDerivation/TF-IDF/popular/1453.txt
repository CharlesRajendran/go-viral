It is a shame that this film is not available on video or DVD in the NorthAmerican format. (It is available in the PAL Video format.) I have notseenthis film for a couple of years, as it was only shown by a few UHFstations,usually at an ungodly hour around Christmas. The film strikes a goodbalancebetween unsentimentality and an affirmation of the Christmasspirit.
