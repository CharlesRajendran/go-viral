A lot of people think this was Sidney Toler's best Charlie Chan film. Idon't know about that, but it is one of his better ones, that's forsure. It featured a lot of suspense, along with action and humor - agood bit of everything that makes the Chan movies popular among itsfans.Charlie travels to San Francisco to find out if a friend of his reallycommitted suicide or was murdered. Son "Jimmy" (Sen Yung) comes alongfor the ride, for some help and some humor. The story revolves aroundthe occult, a familiar theme in films back in the '30s and '40s.Charlie provides an a solid challenge to the charlatans who practicethe occult and bilk people out of their money believing in thathocus-pocus. While Chan disproves that stuff, there is one case of awoman definitely having mind-reading abilities that our Chinese friendacknowledges.A very young (and almost unrecognizable the first time I saw this)Caesar Romero plays a magician, and skeptic ghost-buster and somethingI can't say without giving away the ending. He was a likable guy and agood edition to the movie.In all, a fun 75 minutes. Now, if we could just get this to come outDVD.
