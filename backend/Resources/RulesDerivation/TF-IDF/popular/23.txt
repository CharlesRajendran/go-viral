Every time I see this movie, I can't prevent myself to think of anotherthriller from the 50's: "711 Ocean Drive", a little masterpiecedirected by Joseph M Newman.The topic is nearly the same. A "honest" worker becomes greedy,ambitious, ruthless and implicates himself with gangsters, planning totake over crime syndicate. In this case, it concerns stealing oil.Ifind it unusual. A man who is not a thug at the beginning, that's themost interesting. Of course, what happens next is predictable.Gene Barry gives us a pretty brilliant performance.I recommend it. Catch it if you can.
