Director Ettore Scola weaves a sensitive comedy-drama about the friendshipof three men and the one woman each has loved. The men meet each other nearthe end of the Nazi occupation of Italy. As the next thirty years pass theyremain friends although their lives take very different paths and becometinged with sadness and regret. The woman who pops in and out of their livesis Luciana (Stefania Sandrelli), an aspiring actress whose career peaks whenshe is cast as an extra in a Fellini movie. The three perennial friends areplayed by Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi and Stefano Satta Flores. Veteranactor Aldo Fabrizi (the priest in OPEN CITY) does a remarkable turn as apowerful industrialist who is as grotesquely unlikeable as he is grotesquelycorpulent. Film buffs will enjoy the way Scola has cleverly included footageof DeSica\'s THE BICYCLE THIEF along with scenes of De Sica explicating thatfamous movie of his. They will also enjoy a funny re-creation of the filmingof the Trevi fountain scene from LA DOLCE VITA, complete with MarcelloMastroianni and Federico Fellini. This is a very beautiful film about howindividuals and society change over the years while friendship, "amicizia",remains an enduring value.
