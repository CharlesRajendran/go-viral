Between Two Worlds was a 1944 remake of the 1930 Leslie Howard film,Outward Bound, which was a hit on Broadway. This allegorical tale aboutdeath was the perfect World War II film and boasted a super ensemblecast--each and every cast member is wonderful. The stars, JohnGarfield, Paul Henreid, Eleanor Parker, and Sydney Greenstreet, givetop-notch performances, but the film also boasts high points in thecareers of Isobel Elsom, Faye Emerson, Dennis King, Sara Allgood,Gilbert Emery, and Edmund Gwenn. Each actor gets a share of thespotlight as they slowly discover their fate and face the finaljudgment. Nicely directed with a good set, although the music picks upbits from Casablanca. Moody and yes maybe talky by today\'s standards,but very effective and moving. My favorite is haughty Isobel Elsom, thegreat British actress who came to Hollywood in the mid 30s, after beingone of England\'s biggest silent-film stars. She has the role AlisonSkipworth played in the 1930 version, but her imperious demeanor takeson a whole new meaning in 1944, set against the war. This is the kindof film that can\'t be made any more, and when film-makers try, theirefforts sink from view very quickly. Powerful and touching film filledwith great moments. This one is a must see.
