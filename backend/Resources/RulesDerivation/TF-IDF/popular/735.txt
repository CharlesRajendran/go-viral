Watching this film, we couldn\'t help drawing a parallel between whatthe Hilton family went through in the early 40s to the actual conflictin Iraq. The film makes clear the hard times on the families leftbehind. The government, unfortunately, doesn\'t provide for the peoplethat have to sacrifice a great deal by making do with a reduced incomein order to survive, while the men, or women are away in combat.John Cromwell directs the film with an accurate eye for details. Thereis a lovely sequence at an airfield hangar where we see couples insilhouette dancing a waltz. It\'s at that time when war seems so faraway from the lives of the family at the center of the story. This is adistraction that is shattered shortly thereafter when Anne Hiltonlearns about the airplane accident where the young son of her grocerdies. War shows its ugly face no matter how far removed one is from theactual theater of operations, as it is in this case.David O. Selznick adapted the novel in which the film is based. It runsfor almost three hours, and it could have used some cutting, but thismovie has proved to be a favorite for many that have discovered ityears after it was first released.Claudette Colbert was an accomplished actress who made this Anne Hiltoncome alive. Jennifer Jones is a compelling Jane, a girl deprived of afather and confused about what she want from life. Joseph Cotten playsTony, the man who comes into the lives of the Hilton women. MontyWoolley, Robert Walker, Agnes Moorhead all have excellent moments wherethey shine.It was also good to see in minor roles people that would go on to havecareers of their own. Guy Madison, Keenan Wynn, Craig Stevens appear inthe film shortly, but they leave their mark on it.This is a film that will not disappoint.
