"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\'s Court" is a film that has a littlesomething for everyone, and that is what makes it a winner.  It has theright blend of humor, action, intrigue, music, fantasy and charisma.  One ofthe few total straight-to-finish feel good movies, "Yankee" is great foreveryone in the family.  And of all the films I have ever seen, this is myfavorite.  A pretty good recommendation, and I can\'t make it any stronger!Bing Crosby plays a regular Joe who is mystically taken to the realm ofCamelot.  Basically he bums around and goes on adventures, bringing his 20thcentury wit and know-how along.  He teams up with spectacular WilliamBendix\'s Sir Sagramore and falls for the beautiful Rhonda Fleming.  Battles,music, evil plots and laughs ensue.At times it seems a little too self-serving to Bing Crosby, but it\'sunderstandable and at times actually enjoyable.  Bing has his run ofCamelot, singing and bringing mirth to everyone.  The technicolor is alittle cheesy at parts, but by no means does it ruin anything.  It doesn\'tmatter what you\'re looking for, this movie has it; "Connecticut Yankee" isthe perfect movie for when you\'re looking for something that takes itsjoviality seriously.
