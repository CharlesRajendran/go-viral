Yeah Hey Dad. Hmm I\'m trying to think of some really nice things to sayabout it. Basically when Nudge left, the wheels fell off and the show shouldhave been cancelled. Instead they start replacing characters constantly andbring in the "little fat kid" and the show is looking awful.In its day (i.e. 1980\'s) it was funny. Now I need therapy to remove it frommy mind.
