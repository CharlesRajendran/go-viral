This is one of the many films that have a promising synopsis and fail toreally engage.It\'s the story of two young lovers who meet at the ballet in London. Oneworks in the code room at the US Embassy, the other the daughter of theSoviet ambassador. They decide that love transcends politics and run awaytogether. They have an unconvincing escape across the channel during aviolent storm and are last seen sailing away together (to where no-one issure).All the potential for drama and conflict between the two bitter enemies islost and the actors themselves seem unconvinced.
