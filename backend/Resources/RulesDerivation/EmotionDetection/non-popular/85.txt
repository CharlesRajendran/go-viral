From the opening scene of CIA agent Sibelle Hu telling a counterfeiterthat she will let him go if he can beat her in a fight (!) to the sceneof a prostitute comparing her job with that of a hired killer andcoming to the conclusion that "my job is safer, unless the men haveAIDS" (!), "Deadly China Dolls" is a ludicrous mess. Nothing here isoriginal, nothing is believable, and nothing makes sense (the bad guyswant to kill the killers so that there are no witnesses, and where dothey try to do it? In supermarkets and strip clubs, among otherplaces!). The action is sub-John Woo, and most of the villains arepathetically lousy shots. Maria Jo and Miyamoto Yoko do a fair job, butthey are not interesting or engaging. And I don't know what's wrongwith Sibelle Hu, but she looks awful in this movie. (**)
