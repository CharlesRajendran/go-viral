If, like myself, you might be drawn to this picture because of youradmiration of the unique talent of Lee Tracy.....forget it.  Cast as a "goodJoe" rather than the snarly, hyperactive conniver he excels at playing,Tracy is stuck with a role that virtually anyone could have played with asmuch, or as little, distinction.  The story is ludicrous, the attempts athumor enfeebled, and the reliance on confusion of look-alikes reduces theplot - such as it is - to a level that might be appreciated by children, aslong as they aren\'t too mature.  Lee Tracy fans, stay away!  There are manyclassic performances by him elsewhere.For Tom Kennedy fans, it might be worth a look.
