"Tendres Cousines" has generally been placed into two categories in thepast: sex comedy and  those kinds of movies which are mainly about artsycinematography. However, if it belongs in the first category, it is mostlyboring, pretentious, dreary, and painfully unfunny (French movies usuallyfail to distinguish between cute and funny). If it belongs in the lattercategory, than the cinematography is a grainy mix of shots which resembletraditional paintings and also of downright ugly shots which couldprobablybe attributed to the film´s low production values. However, the movie isnotable for a different reason.  While it only has about 9 sex scenes,about4 involve Julien, the film´s 14 year old hero who actually looks 14 if notyounger ! These tend to be relatively explicit, chock full of nudity  andeven hint at incest.  Of course, the movie is probably intended to show acase of what can happen during puberty and what can lead adult or almostadult women (the women in the movie, by the way, are gorgeous) to have sexwith a boy that young. Or, it could just be an attempt at a teenage"Emmanuelle". Nevertheless, it surprises me that this movie was not bannedin the U.S. as child porn - not that it necessarily should be butAmericanstend to be extremely sensitive to the problem of teen exploitation . Allinall, "Tendres Cousines" is a weird and somewhat twisted little movie.Pedophiles and people who think that French people can do no wrong  shouldlove it.
