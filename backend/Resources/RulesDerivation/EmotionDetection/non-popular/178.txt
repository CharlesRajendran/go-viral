I would've shrugged off this typical Tod Slaughter exercise inover-the-top Victorian-era villainy, but there was a character in thefilm which I couldn't ignore. It seems that Slaughter's usualcrook/murderer/lecher is this time helped by another crook named MelterMoss. This man is one of the most vicious anti-semitic caricaturesanyone would want to see. Made up to look ugly, and with a high, nasal,whiny voice, Melter joins with Slaughter's villain, the Tiger, to stealas much as they can from Britain's supposedly noble aristocracy. Ofcourse, the Jewish character is shown to be cheap, worships money, anddoesn't care about the Tiger's stranglings "as long as they don'tinterfere with (his) business." At the time, Britain restricted Jewishimmigration to pre-independence Israel and put the Jews of Europewithin the grasp of Nazi Germany's Final Solution; therefore Englandfreely promoted anti-semitic stereotypes in its films, including,unfortunately, a poor excuse for a B grade melodrama like this.
