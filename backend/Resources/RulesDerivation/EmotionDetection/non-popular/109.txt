Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a so-so cartoon populated byappalling puns and one or two nice moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe,'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standardblack 'n' white Porky cartoon and one of the books-come-to-life MerrieMelodies that were popular at that time. Typically of many of the earlyPorky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a ratherstilted opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the restof the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as anopportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for.Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they bargained for. Aswas sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, the spotlightis thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in anon-animated medium. Laughs are scarce and, while the cartoon is justabout saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little atall to recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' over any of the other below-parearly Porky cartoons.
