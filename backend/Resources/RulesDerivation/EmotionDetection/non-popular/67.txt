In the rough days of teen life trying to find where one belongs inrelationship to one's self, family and friends and the need for changeand breaking away.This movie portrays all of that with great care andfantastic acting by the entire cast.I highly recommend it. What a greatfilm this was- there was good acting, a good script, unexpected momentsof hilarity- and best of all this film stayed close to the book. Manyof the characters' lines in the movie are directly from the book. Ifyou are a fan of S.E. Hinton and her writings, you won't bedisappointed by it. In my mind, "Tex" was even better than "TheOutsiders," at least in terms of the movies. Matt Dillon is superb asTexas McCormick, a quiet, somewhat immature teenager living inOklahoma, the usual setting for Hinton's books. There are few momentsin the film (don't worry, I won't give them away) that were extremelyfunny. However, not only is the humor entertaining in the movie, butthe drama is well done too. Tex faces changes at home, with his friendsJohnny and Jamie, and at school, and the result makes for a captivatingstory line. The selection for the supporting cast is right on in almostevery case- Jim Metzler plays Tex's brother Mason, who has to tend forhis younger brother while also looking ahead to college and his ownfuture. Emilio Estevez is Tex's spunky friend Johnny and Meg Tilly isJohnny's independent-minded sister Jamie, the object of Tex'saffections. Even the filming and quality of the movie is not bad,considering that it was made two decades ago. The music is usuallyfitting in each scene, and the script came off sounding realistic andgenuine. All in all, this is a movie well worth checking out. I thinkthe only thing wrong with this movie is the rating it received; there'sprobably enough swearing in this movie to have earned it a PG-13rating. Highly recommended.
