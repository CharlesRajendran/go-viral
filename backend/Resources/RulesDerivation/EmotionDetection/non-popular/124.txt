A Walt Disney CHIP \'N\' DALE Cartoon.There\'s lots of rodent romance going on at the Acorn ClubwhenTWO CHIPS AND A MISS get together.Here is a very routine Chipmunks film which (ratherembarrassingly) puts their pint-sized canoodling on display.The lovely Clarice, for all her furry allure, would make onlythisone film appearance.Walt Disney (1901-1966) was always intrigued by drawings.As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animalsonscraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in Franceduringthe First World War, he drew figures on the sides of hisvehicle.Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Waltdeveloped a primitive animation studio that provided animatedcommercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters.Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series brokeground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe.Businessreversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, whereWalt\'s older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager& counselor. When a mildly successful series with OswaldTheLucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, thecharacter of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt\'s imagination,ensuring Disney\'s immortality. The happy arrival of soundtechnology made Mickey\'s screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE(1928), a tremendous audience success with its use ofsynchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared,and Walt\'s growing crew of marvelously talented animatorswere quickly conquering new territory with full color,illusionsof depth and radical advancements in personality development,an arena in which Walt\'s genius was unbeatable. Mickey\'sfeisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, buthewas soon to be joined by other animated companions:temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually-challenged Goofyand energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt\'sgrandest dream - feature length animated films. Againstablizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the nextdecades delighted children of all ages with the adventuresofSnow White, Pinocchio, Bambi, Peter Pan and Mr. Toad. Waltnever forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse,orthat simplicity of message and lots of hard work always payoff.
