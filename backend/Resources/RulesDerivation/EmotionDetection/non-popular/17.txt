Benny from Panama (1934) ** (out of 4) This short is part of the "Hal Roach's All-Stars" series and featuresJeanette Loff and Eddie Foy, Jr., who play newlyweds that fall into onedisaster after another. Just as they get settled into their hotel theirfriends show up to party until the middle of the night and then thingsget worse when Benny (James P. Burtis), an old friend of Eddie's showsup for some more partying. This was the first film from the series thatI've seen and I must say that I hope the others are much better. Thiscertainly isn't an awful short but there's still not enough laughs tocarry its 20-minute running time. I think the best portion of the filmhappens at the start when the two are married and right off the bat herdress catches fire and she has to strip in the back of the car only tothen get pulled over by the police. These sequences are things we'veseen in countless earlier Roach films but they're given some new lifehere and the viewer gets a couple laughs. I think the weakest portionof the final are the final ten-minutes or so once the "friends" comeover and destroy everything. The stuff with the party guests simplyaren't funny and things don't get any better once Benny shows up.What's even worse is an animated sequence involving a Panama mosquitobut the laughs still don't come. Both Foy and Loff are in fine form butone wishes they had more to work with. Spanky from the Our Gang shortshas a quick cameo.
