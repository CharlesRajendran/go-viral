This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirelyAfrican-American cast. Every derogatory, disparaging stereotype of the blackAmerican community is featured prominently. I won\'t reinforce the insults bylisting them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons, anddice.One good song by Ethel Waters (and a couple of bad ones), and the fantasticsinging and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis bring the total up tosomething below 1 on the IMDb scale.
