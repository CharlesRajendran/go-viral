In the days before he was permanently playing himself in stories of themodern west, Roy Rogers played a number of real western characters andin Jesse James At Bay he plays the title role. And we learn the 'true'story that being that Jesse was not shot in the back by Bob Ford.When a couple of sharp crooks played by Pierre Watkin and HalTaliaferro cheat a bunch of honest ranchers and farmers out of theirspreads, sheriff Gabby Hayes on the Q.T. sends for Jesse who's beenlying quiet in Nebraska and out of the reach of Missouri lawenforcement. Of course this does present an ethical problem for Gabbyas he is the sheriff and he is sending for a wanted outlaw.But not to be outdone Watkin and Taliaferro use a gambler named ClintBurns also played by Roy Rogers to sully Jesse's image as a Robin Hood.Nevertheless Gabby and Roy as Jesse get on to the scheme and turn it totheir advantage quite cleverly.Roy does quite well in the dual role although later on I doubt hispublic would have tolerated a villainous Roy Rogers. Roy and Gabby haveto contend with a pair of reporters played by Sally Payne and GaleStorm who want the 'real' story.As what was said in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance 'print thelegend'.
