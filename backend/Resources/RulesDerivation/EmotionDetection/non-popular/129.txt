Movie moves right along and has many one liners. Comedic in nature andkeeps one\'s attention. The story line is about two men who are stepsahead of the law and dissolving their partnership in securitiesswindles. Interesting that it has a musical soundtrack in thebackground complimenting the dialog. The two main characters contrasteach other with smart and not so smart personae. Gertie plays thepersistent female bent on bringing additional struggle and trouble tothe partners in crime. If you like early comedy from a not so known cast, good show to watch.Film quality is good even. Steak dinner is 60 cents back then.
