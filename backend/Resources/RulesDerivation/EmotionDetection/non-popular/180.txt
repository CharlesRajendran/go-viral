Nitwits, The (1935) *** (out of 4) Wheeler and Woolsey comedy has the boys playing cigar salesmen who getcaught up in a murder mystery surrounding a killer known as "The BlackWidow". This is a pretty good little gem that manages to be quitehilarious but it also has a good mystery surrounding it. There's alsono doubt that this film influenced Abbott and Costello's Who Done It?not to mention there are other gags here later used by Abbott andCostello. The film has non-stop gags including a hilarious sequencethat involves a chase towards the end of the film. Just about everytype of gag gets thrown out there and the majority of them stick.There's also a very funny scene where Woolsey scares the future deadvictim by singing a song about a black widow. Betty Grable play'sWheeler's girlfriend and the prime murder suspect and she's very goodin her bit role. Black actor Willie Best has some of the funniestscenes, although most of them come in the form of racial jokes.
