I'm a fairly avid film guy -- especially when it comes to the avantgarde and silent tributaries of cinema. (I mean, come on, I took filmclasses from Stan Brakhage for cryin' out loud.)Maybe I'm the stupidest kid on my block, but I'd never even HEARD ofL'Humaine until it played at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival's"Day of Silents" last week at the Castro Theatre.It is absolutely stunning.You could get all snooty and long-winded about this film, but in mymind it all boils down to this: Metropolis meets Frankenstein ingeometry class.I'd even go so far as to say this movie is better than Metropolis ...But I'm the first to admit that my thinking may have more to do withthe fact that I've seen that film a couple dozen times (ie. I know whatto expect when I see it) and I'd never seen this movie at all.When I first started this review, I gave it a 9 thinking nothing'sperfect. But honestly, I can't think of something "wrong" with it.Viewing L'inhumaine for the first time was one of the most moving andsignificant viewings of film in my life. Right up there with 2001 in aCinerama theater in 1968.Georgette Leblanc stands out well above an otherwise truly great castshowing a remarkable amount of breadth in her role. What starts outlooking like a 2D character becomes someone much much bigger (with asurprising amount of subtlety considering the acting standards of boththe French as well as silent film of the time).When I saw it, the movie was accompanied by the incredible AlloyOrchestra playing live (which kind of adds a very appropriate Devoovertone to it all). It's worth taking a look at their Website to seeif/when they're playing with the film. If you've read this far in myreview, it'd definitely be worth making a trip to see the wholespectacle. (I have very little doubt that they'll probably eventuallyrelease a version of the film with their soundtrack affixed. Get it ifthey do.)Thanks for reading.
