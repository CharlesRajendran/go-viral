Weak entry in the Our Gang films is like several other of the shortswhere the gang decides to put on a show. The only real difference isthat the budget is clearly bigger and the film looks slightly better.The plot is that the gang put on the Aladdin tale complete with dancinggirls, songs and monkeys. Its so familiar in the way its done that I'mleft to wonder if the film uses stock footage from earlier films. Whatsworse is that the songs and dancing derail the rest of the film sincerunning a scant 10 minutes the film barely has time to build up anysort of momentum. The only way this is worth seeing it is if youstumble on it or see it as part of a collection.
