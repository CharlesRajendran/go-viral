During all the time I was watching The Chinese Ring I kept thinking Isaw it before and then I learn that this was indeed the plot of an oldMr. Wong film also put out by Monogram. As the Wong series was beforeWorld War II started in Europe only the politics were changed and theygot a little vague in this one.Barbara Jean Wong, a Chinese princess who is in America to purchase warairplanes for what I presume is the Kuomintang air force against theCommunists is shot and killed by a dart fired from an air rifle almostimmediately after entering Charlie Chan's home. With a murder right inhis own home Roland Winters in his first film as Charlie Chan is kindof forced to help the authorities who in this case are represented byhomicide detective Warren Douglas. Tagging along is Louise Currie whois a reporter looking to scoop her rivals on who killed the princess.The Occidentals who the princess had to deal with are one scurvy lotwho saw a cash cow and were milking it for all it was worth. But one ofthem is scurvier than the rest that one murders the princes, her maidand a small mute Chinese boy who's only crime was that he was awitness.The story did not translate that good to a post World War II politicalsituation. Still the players do their best with it and Roland Wintersslips nicely into the tradition of Warner Oland and Sidney Toler as ourfortune cookie aphorism speaking Charlie Chan.
