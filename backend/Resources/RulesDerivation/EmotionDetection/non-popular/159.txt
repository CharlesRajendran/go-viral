ALTHOUGH THE CREATION of this panel show followed that of WHAT'S MYLINE? by about two years, there were both many similarities ; as wellas a great may differences. In true show biz tradition, success spawnsimitation; and it was never more in evidence than here. Like the oldershow, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions was involved.LACKING THE 'GRAVITAS' of its distinguished Sunday Evening precursor,this middle of the week prime time entry was played more for fun.Laughter was king here and no apologies were made for that littleelement. Radio & TV veteran, Garry Moore, reigned over the fun andreined in the Panel.THE COMPOSITION OF the all important Panel was far different than itwas over on Sunday's WHAT'S MY LINE. This show's panelists wereoverall, much more youthful. The Ladies were much more attractive andthe gentlemen more energetic and comedy prone. They were: Actress BetsyPalmer, former Miss America Bess Myerson, Humorist Henry Morgan and AllPurpose TV Radio Man/Gameshow Host Bill Cullen.MOST OFTEN THE show would start with the premise of a particular'Theme'. Physical Fitness, for example, was one that we well recall;having been among the huge numbers of viewers on that evening, circa1960. Available on Youtube.com, this episode also featured some longdistance walkers and swimmers; as well as the NABBA (London)Professional Mr. Universe of 1959, Bruce Randall. For the record, Mr.Arnold Stang's secret was "I'm going to punch my way out of a PaperBag!" He failed, of course.AS JUST A WORD to the wise, once again we must relate that there aresome fine examples of the show just waiting for viewing on Youtube.com.
