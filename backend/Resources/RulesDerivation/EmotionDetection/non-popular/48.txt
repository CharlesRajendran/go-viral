Magnetic Telescope, The (1942) ** 1/2 (out of 4)A scientist, trying to do good, creates a large magnet, which goes outof control after police mess with it. Soon the magnet is bringingmeteors crashing to Earth of course only Superman can save the day.Middle-ground animation isn't a classic but it is mildly entertainingeven though we're following the same story structure from the previousfilms. I've heard a few people say that Lois' character was wonderfullywritten in this series but I have to disagree as she's really comingoff as a narrow-minded fool who just constantly does dumb things to getherself in trouble to where Superman must save her. The animation isfairly impressive this time out with the meteor shower being thehighlight. I still haven't been overly impressed with this series eventhough this is only the sixth one.
