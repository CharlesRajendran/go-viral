This cartoon has the feel of an old-time melodrama in some respects and hasone of the least-interesting Disney villains in Pete.  The Mickey in theearly cartoons is more prone to mischief and is more frenetic, bearing moreresemblance to Krazy Kat than to the mouse that most know and love today.The cartoons were more slapstick early on and Mickey evolved over time.Well worth seeing, it runs on the Disney Channel when the spirit movesthem.I wish the shorts would come into print in a substantialway.
