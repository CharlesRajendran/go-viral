The entertainment value on this priceless and timeless movie is beyondwords! The actors and actresses do a great job portraying the fear thatgets lodged into the people\'s hearts and minds is fantastic!That actress that plays Beth could go on to do some superb work, ifonly someone gave her a chance. She has the look of stardom, and couldeasily pull off any hard rolls thrown her way. Just because this moviedidn\'t get any awards, doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t a great film. Themusic, the acting, and that werewolf!!! are amazing! Hats off toeveryone involved in this movie. I hope all of them go on to greatcareers in the movie business.
