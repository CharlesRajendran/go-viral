Disturbed in his rabbit hole by the noise of foxhounds, Bugs decides toshowthem what a real sport is all about.  Putting on his old Halloween costume(a fox outfit) Bugs picks on the dumbest dog in the pack and starts towindhim up.  This continues even when the rest of the pack getinvolved.I haven\'t seen this short on TV or anything, in fact I had to hunt it downand found it on a video that was more than 10 years old.  I can\'t helpwondering if the reason for this is that networks in the UK are a bitsensitive about showing a cartoon that deals with such an explosive issueasfox hunting.  You may not know, but the banning (or not banning) of foxhunting is a big issue in the UK and I\'m sure the Countryside Alliance(pro-hunt) would not be that keen to see Bugs coming down on the side ofthelefty hunt-saboteurs!Regardless of the political asides (although they add spice) this film isbasic stuff but still quite funny.  The standard trickery is all stillthereand funny, even if it feels a little strange to see Bugs in a full foxcostume for most of the film.  Some jokes are straight lifts from othercartoons and have been done elsewhere (Fudd himself has felt the wrath ofthat log-turning gag).  Despite this it is still worth seeing and isprettyamusing.  Bugs is his usual self despite the outfit, although the dumb dogalmost feels too easy a plaything for Bugs!Overall this is a well animated short that has some funny material even ifcan be recognised from other cartoons.  Those in the UK will enjoy itsimplybecause it is funny to see Bugs cocking a snook at an issue that is apolitical hot potato.  Bugs as a hippy, hunt-saboteur? Who\'d have thoughtit!
