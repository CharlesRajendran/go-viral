Star Boarder, The (1914) ** (out of 4) Lower Keystone short features Charles Chaplin playing the landlady'spet, which doesn't sit too well with the other tenants and it certainlydoesn't go over well with the woman's jealous husband. While this filmdoesn't really work it at least features a couple funny sequences withChaplin doing his magic. Even though we still don't see the Chaplin theworld would end up loving, these early shorts at least show him growingas an artist. One of the better scenes in the film is when Chaplin istrying to learn how to play tennis. The facial expressions of anger arequite funny as is another scene where Chaplin notices the woman'shusband is standing behind him yet he tries to play dumb as if hedidn't see the husband. The rest of the film is pretty weak without toomany laughs, although the ending is a pretty nice kicker.
