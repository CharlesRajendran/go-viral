While most of the Sylvester/Tweety pairings would feature just onebulldog (I seem to recall that his name is Hector) to counterSylvester's actions, "Ain't She Tweet" features a whole garden of dogs.When Granny brings Tweety home from the pet store* - where Sylvesterhad already tried to go after him but had to abort his plan - Sylvestercan't seem to get past the canine ocean. Why must he always suffer so?!Obviously, his mishaps form part of the cartoon's plot line, sort oflike what befalls Wile E. Coyote when he tries to trap Road Runner. Butno matter how you look at it, this is still a funny cartoon. Littlemore than a way to pass time, but worth your while.*I noticed that the shop next to the pet store said I. Wyner. No doubtthat was an in-joke referring to background artist Irv Wyner.
