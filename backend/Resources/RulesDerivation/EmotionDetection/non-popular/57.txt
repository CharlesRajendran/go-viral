A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short.A tiny dreaming tot finds he & his toy dog in LULLABY LAND,where powder puffs & rattles grow on the vegetation andpottyseats march over the quilted hills. Then there\'s the smallmatter of the bogeymen...This is an utterly charming little film, which entices the eyeofthe viewer to pick out all the baby motifs.The SILLY SYMPHONIES, which Walt Disney produced for atenyear period beginning in 1929, are among the most fascinatingof all animated series. Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoonsinwhich action was paramount, with the Symphonies the actionwas made to fit the music. There was little plot in theearlySymphonies, which featured lively inanimate objects andanthropomorphic plants & animals, all moving frantically tothesoundtrack. Gradually, however, the Symphonies became theschool where Walt\'s animators learned to work with colorandbegan to experiment with plot, characterization & photographicspecial effects. The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale, Myth &MotherGoose were all mined to provide story lines and evenHollywood\'s musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed.Itwas from this rich soil that Disney\'s feature-length animationwas to spring. In 1939, with SNOW WHITE successfully behindhim and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon, Waltphased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES; they had run their course& served their purpose.
