Chip n\' Dale are rather static and boring, to me and the Warner BrothersGoofy Gophers are much more entertaining, but they did do a few goodshorts,of which this is one.  I suspect this is because the rivalry here isrealistic and the situation much more interesting.  This one\'s well worthlooking for.  Recommended.
