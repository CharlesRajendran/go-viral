Show Business (1932) * 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely annoying and unfunny Hal Roach short has Thelma Todd and ZasuPitts playing friends who get a call from their agent telling them tocatch a train with their pet monkey because they've got a show to do.Of course, on board the train the monkey causes all sorts of troubleincluding bothering the main star (Anita Garvin) of the show. The moreTodd-Pitts shorts I see I'm beginning to understand why the team didn'tlast too long. Again, perhaps I'll eventually get to some gems but thisshort is downright annoying and rather painful to watch. When it comestime to watch a comedy the last thing you want it to be is painful butthat's exactly what we get here. The biggest problem is that thescreenplay appears to have been written by the monkey because there'sreally no laughs to be found. Just take a look at one of the earliestscenes when Pitts is on the phone with the agent. We see her strugglingwith the cord. Not funny. When then see her go up the steps to her roomonly to forget something and go back to the phone. Not funny. We seeher then walk back up the steps only to forget again and have to walkback down. Not funny. The stuff with the monkey causing trouble issomething we've seen in countless other Roach shorts. I'd also say thatPitts and Todd have very little chemistry here and they really don'twork too well off one another. Needless to say, that isn't good whenwe're talking about a comedy team. I think the only highlight is asequence where Todd stands in a rather sexy lingerie, which at leastgives us something to look at.
