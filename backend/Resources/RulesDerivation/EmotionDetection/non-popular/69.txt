In her review for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael quipped thatthe young actor Matt Dillon who stars in "Tex" possessed anextraordinarily natural grasp of acting. This may be true, althoughanother comment from Kael--that Dillon had never played a role likethis before--isn't altogether accurate. Tex McCormick is a rascally,down-home country kid, an Oklahoma high school student struggling tostay out of trouble after he and his brother are abandoned by theirfather, and the role feels like an expansion of Dillon's character from1980's "Little Darlings". There are no surprises from thisup-and-coming star, no revelations, and not a trace of personalsubstance on display. Dillon falls for the daughter of self-righteousBen Johnson, who seemingly always plays self-righteous (no surprisesfrom him, either). Johnson's way of acting is to pontificate clearly,as if he were making a speech in the town hall. This Disney drama,taken from S.E. Hinton's novel, is rather slow and fuzzy--and after anhour, the audience is still waiting for the plot to take shape. Therural locations are capably captured, but the drama inherent in thestory of these two brothers lays flat. *1/2 from ****
