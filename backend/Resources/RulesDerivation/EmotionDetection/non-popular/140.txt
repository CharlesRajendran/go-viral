This Disney cartoon features the first appearance of Donald Duck'snephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie - sons of Donald's sister, Dumbella. Asthey're little kids, they prove to be rowdy and troublemakers, almosttoo much for Donald to handle.There isn't much chemistry or family bonding between the uncle andnephews, just the kids playing mean tricks on their uncle, whichdoesn't make them very likable. It is neat, though, hearing ClarenceNash provide the voices for all the characters, and him making Donaldlose his temper is just classic and funny.The story line could have been better, as the nephews didn't have muchredeeming qualities. As least Donald tried to read a self-help book tolearn how to deal with children!Grade C-
