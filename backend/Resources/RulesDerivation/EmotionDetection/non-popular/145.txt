One of Bollywood's memorable themes. The story of "Ruba", thescar-faced girl, is still remembered by Hindi film goers. The theme isset in a village, where "Ruba" is born and her mother dies right aftergiving her birth. This unfortunate event leads the villagers (includingher father) to mark "Ruba" as "cursed" & as fate would have it one sideof her face gets burned assuring her being cursed. She grows up tobecome a beautiful young woman (Zeenat Aman)-hiding the burned side ofher face- with an angelic voice, until the newly appointed engineer(Shashi Kapoor) arrives at her village, hears her voice & falls in lovewith it. The rest remains to be seen in this masterpiece made by thegreat late filmmaker "Raj Kapoor".The film gives the message to fall in love with internal beauty.Do not miss watching this movie for it's great acting, locations,excellent music/ songs & of course memorable direction.
