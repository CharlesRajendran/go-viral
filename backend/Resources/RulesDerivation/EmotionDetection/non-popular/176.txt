Suspense (1913) **** (out of 4)This semi-remake of D.W. Griffith's 1911 film A WOMAN SCORNED takesmany of the masters best known techniques and adds new one to themmaking the end result certainly live up to the title. A woman's maidquits without notice leaving her and her baby all alone when a trampcomes upon the house, finds a key under the door mat and decides tocome in. The woman frantically calls her husband at work and he musttry and get home before the tramp reaches his wife. This is one of themost legendary films from this era and it's easy to see why because notonly does it take stuff from Griffith but there's also enough new stuffhere that you'd have to wonder if someone like Fritz Lang or AlfredHitchcock saw this and learned some of their trade. There are so manywonderful moments here including one where the camera is placed abovethe tramp looking down on him. Another great scene happens when a caraccidentally runs over a man and the way it's shot is just breathtaking to watch. The most important thing seen here are a couple splitscreens where the screen breaks down into three sections and we get tosee what all the major characters are doing. This is used to greateffect when the wife is on the phone with the husband and the trampcuts the phone line. As was the case in many Griffith films, the endingpretty much has the good guy having to reach the bad guy before it'stoo late and directors Phillips Smalley and Lois Weber (who plays thewife) do a terrific job at slowly building up suspense and then pushingit into high gear once everything begins to mount up.
