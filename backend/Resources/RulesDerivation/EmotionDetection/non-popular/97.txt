even taking into account the context of its time, this is incrediblydated, morals-wise. also, it strains credibility that the femaleprotagonist (amy) would stay initially, stay later, stay longer,proclaim her love for (the wrong guy), and then leave w/o gettingtogether w/who she wanted all along. just seems really dopilycontrived. "she DIDN'T know what she wanted" would be a more apt title.also, the whole plot revolving about her pregnancy just comes from outof nowhere and dominates the proceedings as if it was 1750 in puritannew england. i really wanted to like this film; i'd heard it was good -- but it's really pretty hard to take. as for tony; he's similarlyunbelievable, a 1-dimensional character, until he explodes, and then hebecomes 2-dimensional (still 1 short). OK i'm done
