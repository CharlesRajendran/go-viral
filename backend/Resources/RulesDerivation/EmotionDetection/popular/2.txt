let\'s weigh the merits of this film: (1) a strikingly handsome (andtall), youthful Gary Cooper -- this is the opportunity to see a giantscreen legend when he was a vibrant young newcomer! This alone meritsseeing this movie. (2) The dialogue is witty, pithy and fun -- in fact,give me the screenwriter from 1931 over most of today\'s movies!. (3)There is a lot of fast-paced and exciting western action (and thestuntwork is just plain fun to watch). Yes, this was relatively earlymovie making, and in some ways it shows, but that also providestremendous enjoyment for the film buff. Watch it with a light heart,but with reverence for the old films, and I think you can\'t help butenjoy it.
