An evil Egyptian priest menaces a young Roman maiden whileablind slave girl shows great courage in attempting to rescueher beloved master, during THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII.Produced less than two decades after the birth of cinema,thissilent film is considered to be the first important historicalepicfilmed on a truly grand scale. It also heralded the arrival oftheItalian movie industry as a force to be reckoned with,howeverbriefly, in the halcyon days before World War One.Produced by prolific director Mario Caserini (1874-1920),itfeatures a completely static camera which has the effectofturning each shot into a living tableau. (The only exceptionsare a few pan shots of flowing lava which were inserted inthefilm\'s final moments.) Caserini manages his early crowdscenesvery nicely, in which everyone looks like they\'re actuallydoingsomething and have a reason to be in the shot. The use oflight& shadow on the large sets is also most commendable.The final twenty minutes, when Vesuvius blows her top anddestroys Pompeii, features special effects which are stillquiteimpressive. After more than an hour of silver toned film,theabrupt switch to red tints at the instant of the eruption isadefinite attention grabber.Much of the acting is very theatrical & overripe, but thatwasthe style back then and was probably much affected by grandopera. Two performers should be noted - Fernanda NegriPouget is quite touching as the tragic blind girl, andUbaldoStefani, as the hero, is unintentionally hilarious in the sceneinwhich he drinks a witch\'s poisoned brew.The film\'s final moments embrace a mature sensitivity andhighlight the latent power of the cinematic image.
