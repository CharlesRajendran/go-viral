1982, a small neighborhood theatre in my hometown.  A double feature of"TheFrench Line" and a Universal film (both Technicolor and 3-D).  "The FrenchLine" was a hoot and a half!  When the posters outside of the theatreproclaimed "JR in 3D!", they really meant what they said.  During severalmusical numbers, when she would turn from profile and face the camera withher chest thrust out:  watch out!  You almost felt you should move awayfromthe screen.  It\'s not "Gentlemen to Prefer" blondes, but the total 1950sofit, the tacky musical numbers (no tackiness on Russell\'s part, though, asshe was a capable singer) and that "just hold on feeling" you got from anRKO production when the studio was going through it\'s death throes, camethrough.  A delightful movie, and, although, I am not a Jane Russell fan,Iadmire her as a performer and a very capable actress.  She carries themoviethrough on star power.  A couple of costumes in the movie caused the movieto be condemned by the Catholic League of Decency in the USA as "unfit forall".  How times have changed!  Like a previous reviewer said, it couldnotonly be shown on the Disney Channel, but probably already has, and on aSunday morning, too!  I\'ve seen the movie on AMC, and the video transfersare horrible, but if you ever, EVER get a chance to see it in a theatre in3-D, run, don\'t walk.  You\'ll have a great time.
