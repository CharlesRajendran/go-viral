Unlike the other reviewers above, I enjoyed this film immensely,probably because I am a Margaret Lockwood fan and collect as many ofher films as I can when they are available.This one is not commerciallyavailable but I managed to find a dealer on Ebay who specialises in theolder films I like.The other reviewers mention it is too "talky" butthis is not supposed to be "Die Hard" or even a James Bond adventure.Itis a cultured British film, from Republic films, from 1952 with anexcellent cast who speak with wonderful diction and enunciation before"kitchen sink drama" mesmerised film producers.Herbert Wilcox (AnnaNeagle's husband) produced this gripping thriller that keeps youguessing right up to the very end.I will concede that the plot is attimes a bit like an amateur dramatic society but this gives it itsintrinsic charm especially when the principal parts are played by goodprofessional actors.An example is Orson Wells sitting in an armchairand filmed from the rear redolent of a James Bond villain.He onlyneeded to be stroking a white cat on his lap!! Michael Wilding playshis usual debonair self as "Philip Trent" the artistic crimereporter.Margaret Lockwood plays again the pianoforte (see my critiqueof "Love Story" (1944) when she played Lissa Campbell),This time wehave the pleasure of listening to Eileen Joyce (the real pianist)playing the famous Mozart piano concerto no:24 in C minor, larghettomovement.Eileen's other famous film credit was playing the Rachmaninov2nd piano concerto in C minor for "Brief Encounter (1945).Orson asmentioned was fond of Shakespeare's "Othello" and some of this plot isworked into this film.Like "The Third Man" (1949), Orson does notappear until late into the film but he immediately makes his notinconsiderable presence felt as "Sigsbee Manderson".Margaret playsMargaret Manderson his wife.No trouble remembering her name by thecast!John McCallum gives a workmanlike performance as John Marlowe, thesecretary to Manderson and Miles Malleson for once leaves aside hisclerical garb to play Burton Cupples, Margaret's uncle.What amused mewas seeing a very young Kenneth Williams playing a garrulous Welshgardener! You would only see this film if you you actively set out toacquire it since it never appears on the the TV and as I said is notcommercially available.Obviously being a thriller I will not divulgethe plot.Suffice to say it ends happily for all concerned.I rated it8/10. Since I wrote this critique in July 2007 this title is nowcommercially available from www.silversirens.co.uk Enjoy!
