It is unusual to even see a film being made about this kind of subjectmatter. Gurdjieff is an important figure in the history of religion,and this film is interesting in that it not only has a performance byTerrance Stamp in it, but also the fact that the Sufi dancing in it isauthentic, as far as I am aware. Also, as far as I am aware, this isthe only time that anyone in the outside world has ever been allowed toobserve this form of sacred dance that the Sufis have been using forthousands of years. Additionally, the meetings that he has with some ofthe individuals who are spiritually advanced are handled intelligentlyand realistically. A must for anyone on the spiritual path.
