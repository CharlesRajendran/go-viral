"The Bribe" is a somewhat slow noir drama starring Robert Taylor, AvaGardner, Charles Laughton, John Hodiak, and Vincent Price. With a castlike that, nothing is all bad. Though the story drags in spots and thebad guys are somewhat obvious, it still makes for good viewing. Tayloris Rigby, a fed investigating war surplus violations involving the saleof airplane motors in a place called Carlotta in South America. Thesuspects have been narrowed down to two Americans, Tug Hintten (Hodiak)and his wife, Elizabeth, a singer (Gardner). Once in Carlotta, Rigbymeets J.J. Bealer, portrayed by Charles Laughton, and Carwood (VincentPrice). They're worth watching, too, though Rigby becomes instantlydistracted by Elizabeth. Their love story develops overnight, whichmight seem strange, but it's Ava at her most gorgeous and Taylor at hismost ruggedly handsome. You can hardly blame either one of them. Thequestions for Rigby are: Where are the motors being hidden, who's thehead guy, who's involved...and how involved is Elizabeth? The movie,with the exception of the finale, is fairly routine stuff. Laughton andPrice have the best roles. Laughton is fabulous as a slovenly loserwhose feet hurt, and Price is excellent. Everyone else is good,including Hodiak, his career in major nosedive as he appears in asupporting role, though a showy one as a drunk with a weak heart. Thebig action takes place at the finale, which is exciting and visuallymarvelous. We could have used a little more of that type of thingthroughout the film.
