This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have seen thousands of moviesbutnone can come near Captains Courageous for its warmth, compassion, dramaandmeaningfulness.  A wonderful story of single-parent bonding and heroworship.Spencer Tracy as Manuel the Portugese fisherman was absolutely fantastic.Just looking at the sparkle in his eyes when mentoring Harvey (FreddieBartholomew) was beautiful.  I have shown this film to my senior class inStrategic Management and they all loved it.  And what a supportingcast,Lionel Barrymore, Melvin Douglas, Mickey Rooney, John Caradine.It was  also one of the first Hollywood movies to treat a black characterwith dignity and respect.  The ship\'s cook was even bilingual, speakingbothEnglish and Portugese, and was a respected member of the crew, not justanUncle Tom.They don\'t make them any better than this--and not a single word ofprofanity, no sex or sexual episodes, must a wonderful story, well acted,sad but uplifting.
