If I could take only ten movies to a desert island, this would be oneof them. This movie captures all the things that "A Christmas Carol" issupposed to be. Watching Alastair Sim interpret the role of Scrooge andthen looking at other actors, I see his incredible facial expressions,the loss of soul that haunts him, the vulnerability (yes, I mean it; heis actually pitiable at times), the loss of love from his oncebetrothed, and the terrible loneliness suffered at the hands of avengeful father and the loss of his kind and loving sister, Fan. Thenthere are the wonderful images and the haunting music. The excellentsupporting cast. Mervyn Johns is an excellent Cratchett,multi-dimensional and fun loving. Michael Horden as Jacob Marley(definitely the best performance as the ghost). Scrooge is shown to becalculating at every juncture, but seems to know that in many ways heis wrong. His avarice becomes his mistress and he can't forsake her.There are wonderful little scenes that I remember. When he stops tohave dinner at the restaurant and is told more bread will cost extra,he decides to deny himself a little bit of warmth. There is the scenewhere Fezziwig loses his business to Scrooge (not a part of theoriginal book but it works fine in the film). Scrooge hesitates for amoment and then barges on, and shows his insensitivity by retaining aworker at a reduction in salary. The scene where Marley is dying andScrooge waits till the end of business. He then comes to the house andasks "Is he dead yet?" We all know the ending, but there is a joy, ablissful excitement not found in any of the other films. This is allattributable to Alastair Sim. He carries every moment. He shows us whatreal acting is all about. I treat myself to this movie a couple times ayear and it never tires me. See it if you never have.
