This movie was surprisingly good.....I watched simply because I usuallylikeJoan Crawford movies, but once this film began I was completely hooked.Theperformances were all first rate, and the script was excellent.  JoanCrawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda were equally great in theirrespective parts, in fact, I thought it was one of Henry Fonda\'s betterearly roles.
