If you want suspense, drama, excitement - find another movie.  This is pureentertainment with a huge cast of top name stars.  The story is a poorexcuse to parade the big names, but who cares about plot when you have thishistorical document demonstrating how "old fashion decent folks" used tobehave.  The canteen was real, the stars banded together to do their partfor the war effort.  As a retired military officer I remember the good dayswhen the military was respected and treated just as good as it was shown inthe movie.I could never imagine todays self centered stars banding together to dosomething similar to the Hollywood canteen.  Hurray for Hollywood - the realentertainment folks with true talent.
