Richard Barthelmess, Helen Chandler, David Manners, Elliott Nugent, and JohnMack Brown star in this excellent psychological war drama directed byWilliam Dieterle about a handful of WWI veterans who do nothing but drinkbooze and run around Paris with flapper, Nikki (Chandler, in an elegant andmoving performance).What makes this film so special is that it\'s mood of despair of hopelessnesshas held up very well over all these years. Plus, the movie\'s bleakatmosphere and subject matter helps. Sometimes the performances (DavidManners) and dialogue comes off as a little dated, but that is to beexpected from a movie this old. It is very easy to overlook; and that isreally the only bad thing about the movie.It\'s a shame that this movie isn\'t released on DVD or even VHS (thankgoodness for TCM). It\'s a real forgotten gem of early 1930\'s cinema thathopefully won\'t remain forgotten for long.**** out of ****
