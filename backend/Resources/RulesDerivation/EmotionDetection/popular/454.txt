This 1939 movie, a period piece set in the early 1760\'s, comes from thedayswhen John Wayne took second billing to Claire Trevor, as he had that sameyear in "Stagecoach", the film that made Wayne a star.  It is a somewhatforgotten film, but it doesn\'t deserve to be, since it tells a really goodstory in a really entertaining fashion.  And it has a greatcast.Wayne plays Jim Smith, leader of a band of settlers of southernPennsylvania\'s Conococheague Valley in the years immediately following theFrench and Indian War.  Smith & Company\'s efforts to deal with a crookedIndian trader (veteran Hollywood villain Brian Donlevy) are hampered by anofficious, pig-headed, and not-too-bright British Army officer (veteranHollywood stuffed shirt George Sanders).  Smith also has to deal with thelocal tomboy (Miss Trevor) who has a deep yearning for adventure andexcitement, as well as the affections of Jim Smith.Wilfrid Lawson also appears as MacDougall, the rowdy Scotsman who lovesfighting almost as much as drinking.  John F. Hamilton is the eloquent butenigmatic sidekick, known as the Professor.  Moroni Olsen, possessor of oneof filmdom\'s coolest names, is the stalwart Tom Calhoon.  Veteransecond-string Hollywood villain Ian Wolfe is the evil trader\'s Evilsidekick.  Also appearing in small roles are Chill Wills (another coolname)and Charles Middleton, heretofore best known as the stone-faced Fredonianprosecutor in "Duck Soup".Interesting historical detail: in a courtroom scene, a witness is asked to"swear or affirm" that what he\'s about to say is the truth, the wholetruth,and nothing but the truth.  This should serve to remind the viewer thatPennsylvania was a Quaker Commonwealth.  (Quakers don\'t believe inswearing,you see...)
