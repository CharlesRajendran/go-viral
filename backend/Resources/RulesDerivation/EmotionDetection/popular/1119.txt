Darker in tone than most Disney animated features (except for \'Hunchback ofNotre Dame\'), \'Pinocchio\' came shortly after \'Snow White\' and showed markedimprovement in the art of animation technology to produce startling specialeffects.The first twenty-five minutes alone raise the film to the level of trueanimation art. Gepetto\'s inventive clocks come to life as realistically asany real-life photography could do. The warmth and cosiness of his dwellingand the charming shenanigans of Figaro the kitten and Cleo the goldfish, areall perfectly realized. The imaginative use of music and animation art isnever finer than in these opening scenes.Afterwards, as the plot thickens, the special effects are just asimpressive. The scene of Gepetto searching for Pinocchio with a lantern on arainy night after he has been captured by Stromboli is unforgettableimagery. The wagon lurching along roads with Pinocchio in a cage is afrightening thing. Even darker are the adventures that await Pinocchio whenhe reaches Pleasure Island. The scene of the boys turning into donkeys isprobably one of the most awesome and frightening moments in thefilm.Altogether charming are the underwater sequences before the meeting ofMonstro the Whale. The climactic chase after the escape from the belly ofthe whale is handled brilliantly. The music perfectly accents the dramaticchase for this sequence and the songs throughout are in keeping with themood and characters of the story. It is the sharp contrast between thelighter moments and the darker ones that gives the film a correct blend offantasy and horror.Parents should be cautioned that very young children may be frightened. Hasto be considered one of the most beautifully animated Disney features of alltime. A treasure to see again and again.
