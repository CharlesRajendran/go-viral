I saw this movie "I\'ll Never Forget You", about 20 year ago and it wasvery entertaining. The story was very fresh ,in the sense that it wasnot a retread as we are all use to now a days. I would go as far as tosay, it\'s one of the best fantasy / dramas of 20th century film making.Tyrone Power and Ann Blight performances make us believe theircharacters. The fantasy and drama of this film really comes through. I,for one, would like to see it re-released on DVD, so young peoplecould get a chance to see it. You know, the violence, we call moviemaking now days, is not conducive to entertainment or brain power. Thismovie is entertaining and leaves room for thought.
