"The Island Of Dr.Moreau" is the remake of the H.G. Well\'s 1933 Classic"Island Of Lost Souls".Burt Lancaster is great as Dr.Moreau. This is a very well done movie. Themake-up of  Tom Burman & John Chambers is outstanding. All of thecreatureslook very realistic.This is a movie that I would love to have on DVD.I never saw the other remake of this. But from what I have heard, it waspretty awful.Classic Lines:What Is The Law? Not to walk on all fours.What Is The Law? Not to shed the blood of another man. That is thelaw.....
