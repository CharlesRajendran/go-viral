Subtle and nuanced in most places, a bit obvious in others, Since youwent away may be the best war movie ever made that doesn\'t have a warscene. It follows the life of a family in the early days of America\'sentry into World War II. The coming of age thrust upon young men andwomen is splendidly captured, but central is the silent pain and worryof those who with loved ones in harm\'s way. Watch for the scene whenMr. Mahoney leaves the movie theater. There is no dialog, and thereneed not be.This movie is often shown near the Holidays because of a greatChristmas scene,it\'s general warmth, and its theme of Country, God, andFamily.One of Jennifer Jones\' best performances, with strong work by ClaudetteColbert, Shirly Temple, Joseph Cotten, Robert Walker, Hattie McDanieland Monty Woolley. Agnes Moorehead foreshadows her role years later inthe series \'Bewtiched\', playing the town \'witch\'.
