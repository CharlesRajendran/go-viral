Acknowledgments to Cole Porter from whose lyric CanCan (the title song ofhis 1953 Broadway show of the same name) I take my one linesummary.This is, purely and simply, a Valentine to Paris, the Belle Epoque, theImpressionists, you-name-it.  As such it is both stunning andsumptuous.Gabin - who began in the French Music Halls - is superb, butthenwhen isn\'t he, Arnoul is a revelation.  More?  Well, the photography is...the music is ... the ambience is ... aw, what the hell, go see it, doyourself a great big favor.  9/10
