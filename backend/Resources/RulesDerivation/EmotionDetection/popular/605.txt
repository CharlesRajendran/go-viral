If I had to choose a western as a model of the highest qualities thatwere present in the 50's and were lost after the 60's it would be "TheOutriders". It is not one of the greatest, but as far as entertainmentis concerned, it sure delivers. It has a great typical western storyabout three Confederate prisoners who escape (McCrea, Barry Sullivanand James Whitmore) and end up with some Quantrill's followerscommanded by Jeff Corey. Corey sends them on a mission to join acaravan which is leaving Santa Fe, which is carrying gold, and whoseleader is the notorious silent movie actor Ramon Novarro. They willfollow the caravan up to Cow Creek where it will be bushwhacked. Theonly woman present in the caravan is the beautiful Arlene Dahl. Thereare two great moments in the film: 1)They cross a river with atremendous current with a raft tied at one side and using the currentto get to the other. 2) there is a dance with the men drunk, and Arleneas the only woman tries to dance with them all and ends up dancing withMcCrea, very sensual scenes. If you like westerns, don't miss this one.
