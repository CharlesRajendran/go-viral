Pearl White was a serial queen of the B films of the silent period and thisis a take on her life--a humorous one, tailored of course to suit BettyHutton\'s style of clowning. The story begins with Hutton working in a sweat shop and doing one of herfrantic song routines before she lands a part with a traveling repertorycompany where she falls for conceited leading actor John Lund. Lund playsstraight man for Hutton\'s mugging and one scene in particular will have youlaughing out loud as Hutton--drenched from the rain--attempts to recite hernext line without sneezing. He proves an excellent co-star.Adding to the merriment is Constance Collier as a wise, veteran stageactress who attempts to teach Pearl the tricks of the trade. Billy de Wolfeand William Demarest add to the fun and there are some nice tunes by FrankLoesser.Definitely one of Betty Hutton\'s better pictures, tuneful, brightlytechnicolored and a good showcase for her talent.
