The interesting expressionist atmosphere and, most of all, a memorableperformance by Greta Garbo (does she give any other kind?) both make"The Joyless Street" worthwhile. G.W. Pabst\'s style also makes a goodcombination with the setting in post-World War I Vienna. The supportingcast is also good, and all of this makes up for the lack of afirst-class story.Garbo is well-cast as the daughter who is the only real hope of animpoverished family trying to survive in a cold, unforgiving postwarcity that is ruled by a handful of predatory exploiters. Just her eyesalone communicate volumes, and her character transcends the rest of thematerial. Pabst wisely included plenty of close-ups of Garbo, and theseleave a lasting impression of her character\'s weary perseverance andstrength of character.Several of the other characters also have interesting stories of theirown. There seem to be a number of different versions of the feature,with widely varying lengths, and thus with the story differentlyedited, so that some versions will work better than others. Butregardless of the story, the setting is effectively rendered, andGarbo\'s performance stands out.
