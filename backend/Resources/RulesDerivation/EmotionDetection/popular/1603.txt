The Barbarian Queen is Queen Amethea (Lana Clarkson), whose village isburned by evil warriors on the day of her prospective wedding, after whichmost of the people are killed or enslaved.  She leads a group of rebels inopposition, including some women (like herself) whose forms fit well intothe clothing of the day, and eventually leads an uprising by freeing theslaves.  Not for its cultural or intellectual value at all, this film ismost noteworthy for the women winning the swordfights with men but notfaring so well if they are captured and/or enslaved.  Nudity and bondageandfondling yes, but I have to say the most memorable scene occurs when QueenAmethea uses a unique method of escape after she has been captured andtiedup in the warrior camp and is being fondled by one of her captors.  Clearcut--for those who like this stuff yes, otherwise not much to offer.
