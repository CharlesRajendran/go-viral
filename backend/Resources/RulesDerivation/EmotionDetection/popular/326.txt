One of those rare, subversive films that skip through the Hollywoodgenericnet.  It has everything - a love story, filmed with all the delicatevisualpoetry of a silent melodrama; a bizarre social critique that compares arepressive social order (eerily foreshadowing life under capitalism) withthe caged animals in the zoo.  Climax one of the most extraordinary in allcinema - love story equated with social revolt; animals rebel in violent,Surreal chaos.  Liberating and ravishing.
