Perky June Allyson and lovely Gloria DeHaven are two vaudevilliansgiven a chance to open their own canteen for military personnel by amysterious benefactor. The very thin plot revolves around this simplepremise and at over two hours running time it becomes very stretchedindeed. However, as this is an MGM movie, there is much to enjoy thanksto the plethora of studio talent involved. The highlights for me weregorgeous Virginia O\'Brien doing her usual \'deadpan\' number, JuneAllyson\'s terrific \'Young Man With A Horn\', beautiful Lena Hornesinging \'Paper Doll\' and who could resist Jimmy Durante performing\'Inka Dinka Doo\'? The production is lavish with huge sets, hundreds ofextras and fabulous costumes. The bizarre dream sequence is quiteeye-popping and even includes a fashion parade with some trulybeautiful models. Quite an extravaganza!
