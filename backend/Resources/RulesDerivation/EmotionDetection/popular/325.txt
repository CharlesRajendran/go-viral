I have always wanted to see this: A friend\'s mother told me many yearsago it was her favorite movie as a child.It\'s a lovely creation. Gene Raymond, in surely his most appealingscreen role, plays a Dr. Doolittle type who works at the zoo. Raymondwears a cap throughout, covering his marcelled blond hair. Hischaracter was decades ahead of PETA: When wealthy women come in wearingfurs, he steals and burns them. And he has a very believable way withthe animals.The animals and birds are filmed gorgeously by Lee Garmes. In a later,better movie animals watch over the goings on of the human charactersin a similar way: "The Night of the Hunter." But this is lovely itself.Loretta Young, one of the screen\'s great beauties, looks ravishing asan orphan who slips away from the other girls and the evil matrons ontheir outing at the zoo. A child who does the same is thrown in, tolittle effect. Adorable children were in vogue at the time but hischaracter is unnecessary and not especially appealing.O.P. Heggie is likable and handsomely photographed as the sympatheticveterinary doctor. And Paul Fix is an effective villain.Anyone who likes animals will be touched by this. Yes, opinion towardzoos has changed since the early 1930s. But we see them treated withnothing but love and understanding, other than by the villain. It issure to win you over.
