George C. Scott is at his best in this adaptation of a Hemingway story(which, if I\'m not mistaken was left unfinished) about a man who, latein life, is experiencing regrets over the loss of time with his sons.The main character, like Hemingway, was married multiple times andalways seemed to run out on them shortly after the children were born.As a result, his relationships with his three sons is strained, to saythe least. It\'s obvious Hemingway was being autobiographical here, butunlike the lead in the movie who tries to make good (albiet late),Hemingway chose suicide over mending fences. At least the leadcharacter TRIES to make a run from his tropical island home to themainland to be with his kids full-time. To me, these parallel stories(true and fictional) makes this movie incredibly sad and wistful, whileat the same time great acting and exceptional writing provide greatimpact as well.
