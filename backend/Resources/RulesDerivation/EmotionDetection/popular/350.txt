I haven\'t seen this movie for decades, but I still remember it well.  It hasa haunting \'twilight zone\' twist to it and is very entertaining.  I\'msurprised, in this in this \'post Titanic megahit\' time, that an ocean linerbackdrop to an eerie, romantic story has not been recycled as was \'DeathTakes a Holiday\'.  It might even be re-incarnated as a \'Fantasy Island\' typeTV series with new passengers every week.You expect justice and good to win out in movies of this era.  It\'s nicethey left enough \'wiggle\' room to do the right thing.  And I think peopletake a comfort from a good movie showing us going on after death.  It\'s atrip we all hope to take one day....
