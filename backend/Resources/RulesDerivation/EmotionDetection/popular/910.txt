It's a little quaint by today's standards, but the writing is witty andthe cinematography is excellent. More than that, it's an opportunity tosee a 36 year old James Mason acting in a role where he ages 25 years.This was the one Gainsborough film he actually wanted to make, althoughhe had hit the top of the charts with other Gainsborough Gothics suchas The Wicked Lady and The Man in Grey. I was rather astonished at hisability to transform his extraordinary brooding good looks into thoseof a kindly, elderly gentleman with a twinkle in his eye. His gait,voice, and body movements so fitted the role of the elderly man, Ibelieve he could have fooled me without all the makeup.
