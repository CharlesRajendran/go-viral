An early musical (Ernst Lubitsch\'s first talkie), so the sound can be hardon the ears (especially Jeanette MacDonald\'s high notes). The plot as suchis forgettable,but see it for the performances.It seems odd to match Jeanette MacDonald\'s operetta singing with MauriceChevalier\'s cabaret, but each gets their own numbers and they join in themiddle for duets.Lupino Lane and Lillian Roth do two wonderful vaudeville style song anddance numbers.
