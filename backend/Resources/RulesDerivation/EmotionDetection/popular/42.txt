From 1923 to 1930 Laura LaPlante was the Queen of Universal Studios.She was a delightful comedienne and a fine dramatic actress. She wasoutstanding in the part-talkie epic "Showboat"(1929) though the filmitself in its current form is mediocre at best. She left Universal in1930 after two musical flops but found considerable success in Englandstarring in half a dozen comedies for Warner Brothers-TeddingtonStudios. "The Man of the Moment"(Warner Bros, 1935) made its U.S. debutlast night and proved once and for all that LaPlante should have had agreat talkie career in the kind of films she excelled in the silenttwenties. SHe makes a delightful pairing with the handsome youngDouglas Fairbanks Jr.. The film is given a glossy Hollywood-stylesheen, the script and direction is excellent, but it is these 2 starsat their charismatic best that makes this constant fun. Why WarnerBrothers did not re-team these two is a mystery....The film never got aU.S. release though Fairbanks was a major star at the time. LaPlante'scareer was going into eclipse but she was still widely known by thepublic.
