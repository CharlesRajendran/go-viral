This film ... which no one seems to admire but me ... I believe to beone of the finest, touching, moving films I know. I do not believe thatBeery plays Polaki as "half-witted" ... I believe his performance is sosubtle that he comes across as much closer to "child-like", and so muchmore endearing. The script is tight. The photography much better thanaverage. Sets are well decorated, lighting is fine. While some mayconsider the ending to be ambiguous, I do not. I think that Laura waitsfor him, and they "live happily ever after." But, to have shown thatwould have degraded to film from representing genuine "seniment" to thetoo-often-used "sentimentality." The character Laura is quite 'real'... we've all know women like her. Can't understand why no one seems torecognize its fine aspects.
