It took a second look for me to enjoy this movie as it didn't reallyappeal much to me on the first viewing. Perhaps a better picturehelped. If I had the Criterion DVD, it would be much better I'm surebut, for now, I'll have to settle for the VHS. This is a very noir-ishwith a lot of dark scenes, so a good transfer is a must.Most of the action takes place at night in London alleyways, nightclubsand gymnasiums. The storyline is a downer, that's for sure. It is arough and sometimes depressing story. Richard Widmark, as "HarryFabian," has the starring role and plays a real loser, a desperate manwho always has a scheme concocted but usually messes up. Some criticsthink this is Widmark's best performance ever. Francis Sullivan isinteresting as the nightclub owner. Gene Tierney gets second billingbut doesn't have much of role in here.Some memorable scenes include a wrestling match with big Mike Mazurkiand "Gregorious." I'm not much into wrestling but this was an amazingmatch, extremely intense.This film is a bit different from most American-based film noirs. It'snot a pleasant story, it's moody, and it has a certain fascination toit.
