The Eagle and the Hawk are Fredric March and Cary Grant, a couple ofenlistees in Britain\'s Royal Flying Corps in World War I. March isGrant\'s training officer and he washes him out as a pilot. Grantresents this of course and bops him one on the snoot. He gets to be atailgunner.When they get over there March becomes an air ace. But soon all thedeaths of comrades around him really gets to him. He\'s a sensitive souland he starts to crack up. By then Grant is on the scene as histailgunner, but they\'re still not getting along.The Eagle and the Hawk covers a whole lot of the same ground as TheDawn Patrol did. But the players here know their business and serve theclich√©s up well done. Cary Grant plays very much against type. A fewyears later the public would never have accepted him in the part heplays here.Jack Oakie is around to do the comic relief. Carole Lombard is in thisas well for about 10 minutes as a woman March encounters while on a 10day leave. I\'m not quite sure what her purpose is in this film otherthan to give the men in the audience something to gape at.It\'s a good anti-war film and the ending will surprise you.
