Last night I watched Pinocchio, Disney\'s second feature-length film and inmy opinion one of the studio\'s best features. Based on the 19th centurybookby Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winninganimation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they\'renever like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and featurethe voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who\'ll be gone in a year)that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When youWishUpon a Star. My favorite song is "Little Wooden Head" which is featured inthe beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro playhappily with the new puppet.The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi\'scharacter) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with agoodheart but who is weak-willed and doesn\'t always listen to reason. Theanimation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring asprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entirevillage at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially loveHonest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never adull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put intotheir films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that waslostin later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was neverasfamous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is hismasterpiece.
