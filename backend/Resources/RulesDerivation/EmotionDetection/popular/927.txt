Ah, human nature!!. No matter how great a film may be there is almostalways someone who will post inane comments about the movie that makesme shake my head in wonder, This is a small masterpiece, a little gemwith a surprising outcome that I thought about for days after seeingthe film. They remade the film in 1992, with an older too Hollywoodish childactor.. The child in the earlier version gives a one of a kindperformance. A six year old actor playing a six year old kid, how thedirector got such a moving performance from someone that young is awonder. His voice was dubbed so I initially thought it was the actordoing the voice-over who was playing the part so well. Then I saw thefilm in Spanish ( I speak the language) the dubbing doesn\'t do justiceto the original performance.You will not find the movie at Blockbuster, so you have to buy the DVD.They issued two versions last year, first a digitally remastered copy,THAN a version that was not computer enhanced. I know, it is confusing. I love this little movie, I have already sent a copy to mygranddaughter in Florida who was weaned on 70\'s films with Technicolor,Dolby and all that stuff. I expect a call in the next few days askinghow I found this "great" movie
