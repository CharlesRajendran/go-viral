The movie, "The Big Lift," starring Montgomery Clift as Flight EngineerDanny MacCullough, represents a time machine back into the beginningsof the Cold War. It\'s shot in gritty black and white by director GeorgeSeaton to enhance the images of life among the ruins of post WWIIBerlin. It\'s also a very nice slice of Air Force flying in the early50\'s and as a professional pilot, I can say that the flying sequencesshowing the C-54 cockpit are quite realistic. In one scene, Clift runscockpit checklists for the pilots who are flying that are completelyauthentic. There is also a nice description of how GCA approach controlworks, which still exists as a backup at todays airports.Some claim that Paul Douglas\' character, "Kowalski," isn\'t believableas an anti-German bigot, but I thought he was "spot-on." There are menin their 80\'s today who still feel the same way.German actor O.E. Hasse portrays "Stieber, the Scrounger." He\'s a bitof comic relief as a spy for the Russians, watching Templehof field,counting the Allied aircraft as they land. He says that he has tolessen the count so that the Russians will believe him. Look for Hassein another excellent war picture, "Decision Before Dawn", where heplays Wehrmacht Colonel Von Ecker of the XI Panzer Corps, deployed eastof the Rhine to counter the American Seventh Army during the closingmonths of the war. Also like "The Big Lift," this movie was shotamongst the ruins of Germany and used real Army personnel on screen."Decision Before Dawn," "Battleground," "The Best Years of Our Lives"and "The Big Lift" are four b+w movies made in this era which attemptedto get a real taste for the movie goer of what the men experiencedduring World War II and the period just after. All four are favoritesof mine and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Thank you forreading my comments.
