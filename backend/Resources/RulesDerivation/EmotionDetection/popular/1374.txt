Elegant, atmospheric and measured. I suppose anyone brought up on fin desiecle Hollywood would interpret that as `slow and boring\'. But this wasHollywood tackling an intellectual piece with, well, intellect. I mustconfess that the thought of a 1945 Hollywood attempt at Oscar Wilde didnotappeal. Memories of one or two previous efforts at English literaryclassicsset alarm bells ringing. But this was in a class of its own. Beautifullyphotographed in black and white, apart from a couple shots of the paintingitself, the aesthetics shimmer.I wasn\'t that convinced about some of the London scenes, especially thelow-life portrayal of the East End. The opium den and the `Two Turtles\',where Gray first meets Sibyl Vane, look rather too genteel. Compare thisview of such places with those created by David Lean, just a couple ofyearslater, in `Oliver Twist\'. And this, in a sense, detracts from the depthstowhich Gray descends in order to be forever youthful and live life withscantregard for others. And in many years of watching BBC Victorian costumedramas I don\'t recall seeing such outfits on the backs of London\'s societyladies! However some of the other detail is first class. In particular SirThomas\'s decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha\'squails\') in spite of Lord Henry\'s outrageous comments rings true throughtotoday. As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory\'.The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield\'s portrayal quite remarkable inthat he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, nodoubt,to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals everyscene he\'s in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde\'s witticisms that wouldhave Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe. Angela Lansbury is, perhaps, alittle too demure for a theatrical singer from the East End but, no doubt,this was a result of director\'s orders.Essential viewing for anyone interested in the history offilm.
