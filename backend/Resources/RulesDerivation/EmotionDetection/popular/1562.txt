Delightful post-war British comedy illustrating for the umpteenth time thefighting spirit of the "ordinary Joe" (or in this case Jock) when setagainst the pomposity of the would-be ruling classes. Capt Waggett (BasilRadford) is the real star here as the middle class representative of stiffupper lippery. Surely Jimmy Perry and David Croft must have drawn on himwhen they were dreaming up the Capt Mainwaring character for thelong-running BBC TV sit-com "Dad\'s Army". Even one of Waggett\'s lines ("Iwas waiting to see when you\'d spot that", a comment usually made whenMainwaring had just uttered some piece of logistical nonsense) made anappearance. Unmissable example of British comedy rooted in the style thatmade Ealing so succesful.
