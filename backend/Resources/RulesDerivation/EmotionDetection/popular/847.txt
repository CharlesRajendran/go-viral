I saw this when it first came out (1945-46) and it struck me then as areally great film. I saw it again tonight on video and still have thesame opinion. This is NOT an historical film. This is a movie versionof G.B. Shaw's play of the same name, just as "My Fair Lady" is amusical play/musical movie based on Shaw's "Pygmalion." The performance by Vivien Leigh (32 yrs. old at the time) as a 15-16yr. old Cleopatra was stunning as was the performance by Raines asCaesar. This is not a vehicle to describe history but rather, a vehiclefor Shaw to present his ideas and comments -- and this movie servesShaw's intent quite well.His little barbs tweaking the British culture and character were welldelivered. His ideas of what things lead to a civilized life and whatthings to a spiral of vengeance and barbarism are timeless and asappropriate to the twenty-first century as they were to the very earlytwentieth when Shaw wrote the play. The cast was great, and the chemistry between all, especially Leigh &Raines, was superb -- as well as the sets and filming, too.
