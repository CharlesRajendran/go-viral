This verson of the HG Wells story is the best and most entertaining everfilmed. Director Don Taylor makes this film shine with creepiness andhorror. Laurance Rosenthal\'s score is hard to find, but a great soundtrackwhen you can track it down. The late Burt Lancaster is fantastic and the"mad" doctor and all the make-up effects are superb! See thisone!
