The lead, Dirk Benedict, is really cool. There is a lot of comedy inthe way he makes monkeys of all of the country rednecks that try totake him out. There is nothing he doesn't know about how to defend andtake care of himself. His relationship with the young and delectableLinda Blair is tender and cute. The country songs, especially "One Day at a Time," complement thehokey, but cool and entertaining story perfectly. The supportingactors, including Ben Johnson and Richard Farsnworth, are great. I'vewatched the film dozens of time, first when it came out on cable in1982, and then after 2000, when I bought the VHS tape. You'll reallyenjoy this film.
