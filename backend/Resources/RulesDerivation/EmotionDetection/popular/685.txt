"Jewel Robbery" reflects the comic virtuosity of actors and actresses - anddirectors - in an eclectic  Hollywood too soon to be stifled by THE Code. Kay Francis, little known to most movie buffs today, sparkles as aliberated, adventuresome and bored wife of a doting, not doddering exactly,but boring rich hubby.  Apparently only his largess keeps her hitched andshe seems quite open about looking for some exciting liaisons and she ain\'ttalking about platonic ones either.  The sexual innuendos aren\'t subtle. Neither are they serious.William Powell is a suave and quick-witted gentleman jewel thief.  In onesentence he dismisses the violence of his American counterparts, assertingthe urbane civility of the European high class criminal."Reefer Madness," one of Hollywood\'s all-time great comedies, came out in1937.  In 1932 Powell, the jewel thief, dispenses marijuana cigarettes leftand right and although the name is never used, the goofy behavior of thesmokers prefigures the exaggerated and demonic grass-induced St. Vitus danceof the later documentary.A short, sprightly comedy where crime is neither dangerous nor particularlyeven objectionable, "Jewel Robbery" is a small gem from a long bygoneHollywood.  If you can rent it, do so.  You won\'t be disappointed.
