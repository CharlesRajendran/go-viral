A rare foray into British films for Gregory Peck, and the journey seemsto have done him good as this film shows him in one of his betterperformances (alongside Roman Holiday and To Kill a Mockingbird).Henry Adams is given the million-pound note of the title and ischallenged to keep it, intact, for a month. And that's the wholepremise of the film - but along the way there is a chase along awindswept street, a dumb strongman, a rich girl, a gold mine, JoyceGrenfell, a bet, and a rather snooty tailor.The film manages to poke fun both at the Americans and the British, aswell as highlighting the class differences still prevalent in thiscountry even today. Henry Adams' plight could be the one of any lotterywinner in 2007, although this being movieland, all works out for thebest in the end.Interesting to compare with Mr Deeds Goes To Town, another film about adotty philanthropist who comes into sudden wealth.
