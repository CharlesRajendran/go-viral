It's just amazing...if he'd wanted to, Ford could've given Sturges orHawks a run for their money. He throws himself into the timing, theriffs. And it's got that whole 30's look: fantastic back-lot town,millions of extras, Vorkapich-y montage sequence. Arthur is hystericalin her "Mannion" sequence. Both she and Robinson are brilliantlydirected. And this film makes Woman in the Window and Scarlet Streetpossible. Who was Robinson to evoke this kind of split character sooften? Tough guy, art collector...I'm not one to spend as much timewith the stories of actors as the stories of directors. But it'sinteresting - he puts the apron on here and "feminizes" himself justlike in Scarlet Street. The economy and understatement of the scenewhere Slugs Martin is killed is perhaps the most "Fordian" moment ofthe film. The chilling quality of what is not shown looks forward tofilms like The Searchers. By the way, I find it funny that the gangstercharacter uses possessive pronouns before his gerunds. I guess theywere better educated then...
