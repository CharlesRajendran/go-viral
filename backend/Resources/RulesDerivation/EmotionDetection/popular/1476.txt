It's really too bad that they only made a few Hildegarde Withersmysteries and that only a few of these starred Edna May Oliver. Thebottom line is that in the 1930s, no woman in Hollywood was more fun towatch in colorful supporting roles than Miss Oliver, so it was a realtreat to see her in a starring role--and one that allowed her coolscreen persona to shine! Instead of the usual somewhat insipiddetective series films, her Miss Withers was a smart-aleck and toughlady--not some pampered playboy or Chinese detective. Plus, it was agreat casting decision to have her work with police detective JamesGleason and give him better than usual writing for such a role. Inpractically every B-detective series, the police are completemorons--so much so that the films lack any suspense or chemistry attimes. Usually you KNOW the cops are all idiots and the amateur sleuthknows everything, but here she is assisted by a reasonably capable copand they work on the case together. Because of this, it was cute to seethat through the course of the film, Gleason's character fell for MissWithers--he grew to love and respect her just like the audience didthroughout the film.For the genre, this is about as good a film as you'll find--plus, ithas cute penguins and Edna May Oliver!! What more could you ask for ina movie?!?!
