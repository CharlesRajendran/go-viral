Robert Taylor is an FBI man looking into a racket south of the borderof black marketeers stealing and selling war surplus material, in thiscase airplane motors. The story takes him to Central America where he meets up with adebonair sportsman, Vincent Price, a rather seedy character with soreand sweaty feet, Charles Laughton and a husband and wife John Hodiakand Ava Gardner stranded in the tropics.They're all suspects, but Taylor is quite ready to forget his job withAva Gardner around. He wouldn't be the first guy to think with hishormones where she's concerned. That's what I'm talking about when Isay more than one kind of bribe.The story is pretty slow moving though. Taylor seems to have theevidence he needs or where to get it. But the plot does drag on. Thefilm seems to rely on the attractiveness of the leads to keep theaudience interested.There are two good scenes, one where Taylor almost becomes a shark'slunch and the climax where the chief villain meets a pyrotechnical end.If you like the cast involved, The Bribe is probably time well spent.
