The story line is familiar and, yes, it does seem to be a hodge-podgeof a variety of legends and myths, but what's to complain about? Manyfilms borrow from a host of differing source material, often withsurprisingly good results.One very important comment about the animation-- If you're the typethat poo-poo's anything less than 21st century computer generatedeffects, then stick to films made after 2000 and stop knocking 40-yearold films because their special effects aren't the same as you saw in"Independence Day". That's like knocking a '63 Corvette because itwon't take you to the Moon.Frankly, I thought the fiery and colorful animation sequences were sortof pre-psychedelic-era psychedelia (if I may coin a phrase). I waspleasantly surprised by the almost bizarre look of it all, and felt akeen sense of having 'discovered' a lost treasure. As an avid filmbuff, with thousands of titles in my film library (both VHS & DVD), I'mquite aware that there are always new (to me) films to be discovered,regardless of how long ago they were made. And-- yes, after seeing this film on cable a few months ago, Ipurchased the DVD for my collection. I rated this film 9- almostentirely for it's visual impact.Highly recommended viewing.
