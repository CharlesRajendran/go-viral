Sure, the pacing is leaden (there\'s silence after every joke so theaudiencecan laugh or applaud), there is no camera movement, it is essentially aphotographed stage musical comedy, nobody can act - BUT - if you don\'texpect too much of this early talkie as film, and just sit back and enjoyit\'s two assets - early two-strip Technicolor and Eddie Cantor - you mayjust enjoy yourself immensely.There are eight songs and two reprises, most memorably MAKIN WHOOPEE andMYBABY JUST CARES FOR ME.Cantor is irrepressible and a total original.  The Jewish shtick and theblatantly gay innuendo in so many of the jokes lay testimony to thisbeingpre-Hayes code, and make viewings by today\'s audiences that muchfunnier.Other reviewers on this site have elaborated on the inane plot, so Iwon\'tgo into it.  The colors are vivid (reds, browns greens)and give this another-worldly look.  The art direction earned an Oscar nom.  If you canfindit, get it and enjoy it.  We have very very few surviving two-stripTechnicolor films and just over a dozen two-strip Technicolor talkiesthathave managed to come down to us with their color elements intact.  Thisis alittle treasure.
