Johnny Cash\'s limited acting ability is remarkably offset by hissemi-autobiographical portrayal of a gospel crusader who wishes to usehalf of the concert earnings to finance his lavishly recklesslifestyle, rather than plough all of the monies into building an ornatetabernacle. His blackmailing wife and one very young concert groupmember are killed off so that his reputation remains unblemished andhis lifestyle can be maintained.Everything you would want in a Columbo story is in evidence here: arefreshingly original, well-thought-out plot with an ingeniouslyconceived "murder" scenario; a very tightly structured script with eachscene leading on nicely from the last; circumstantial clues which areclever and instinctively-developed; an abundance of well-crafted scenesbetween a typically persistent Columbo and a relatively self-assuredmurderer which have a progressive intensity about them; and well-timedinjections of humour.A crackerjack Columbo episode, that is all the better for making itlook like the murderer has won(nb: the marvelous airport scene); andfor not being sentimental when Columbo pities the murderer. Almostflawless in its conception and execution, this must be one of thetop-three Columbo episodes.
