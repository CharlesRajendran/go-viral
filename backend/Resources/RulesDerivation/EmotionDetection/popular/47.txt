What makes this movie so remarkable is that all the actors are castagainst their type. Romantic lead George Brent plays a henpecked hubbyin this film. Glamor gal Carole Landis plays a prissy mouse of ahousewife. Turhan Bey doesn't wear a turban in this film, but plays acool and wise-cracking New York man-about-town. And drama queen AnnDvorak plays a screwball drunk lady with more than one screw loose.It's a gem. Then add to this the remarkable supporting cast, a scriptwith some zingers I can still remember after not seeing this for 40years. And it gets great Cool Points for having legendary jazz artistHadda Brooks play the piano and sing in this film (she also performedin the Bogart / Grahame film IN A LONELY PLACE; and had one of thefirst regular TV shows ever broadcast in Los Angeles in the late1940s).
