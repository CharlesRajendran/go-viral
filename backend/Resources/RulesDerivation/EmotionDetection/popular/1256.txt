This is an atypical and impersonal Ford film. Given the studio(Columbia Pictures) and the screenwriter (Robert Riskin), this is anideal stuff for Frank Capra. But it remains without a doubt one of themost enjoyable and pleasurable comedies ever made. It features gracefuldynamism and vibrancy that are rare in the Ford oeuvre. It is also oneof his fastest movies. It contains what it is probably one of thefinest Edward G. Robinson performances I have seen. He is outstandingin the dual role of a mild, working class office clerk Arthur FergusonJones who is mistaken for a ruthless mobster Mannion (the role heperfected in "Little Caesar"). And then there is the lovely Jean Arthuras Robinson\'s coolly self-reliant co-worker, who starts by pitying himand then encourages him, and ultimately falls in love with him. She andRobinson are superb together. It is nowhere near her splendid presencein Mitchell Leisen\'s "Easy Living" and Frank Borzage\'s "History Is Madeat Night", but this was the sort of role Arthur was to make of her own. A must-see!
