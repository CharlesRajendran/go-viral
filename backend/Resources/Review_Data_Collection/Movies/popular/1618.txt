This early talkie was an exciting experience.The script was charming, the performances intriguing.Author John Monk Saunders managed to combine just the right touch ofwhimsywith the desperation and hopelessness of post-war life.The story was fascinating, a look at what was to become known as "The LostGeneration," or maybe already was so known by 1931.I hope Turner Classic Movies will show this movie again, and I would liketohave a recording.A great cast with an excellent script directed by a master made "The LastFlight" a superb motion picture.I was moved and charmed. And I\'m grateful for the chance to have seenit.
