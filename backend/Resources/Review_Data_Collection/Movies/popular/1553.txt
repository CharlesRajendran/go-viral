I found this film in the bargain DVD bin, so I went ahead and got it.The movie moves slow, but in a peaceful way, capturing the charm ofreal-life in the Caribbean. It\'s mostly an atmosphere-movie -- thecharm of the movie is not so much in it\'s plot (Hemingway writes muchbetter than his movies translate) but in the feel of the characters,and the beauty of its locale.Set in the 1940\'s, it barely touches on WWII, and when it does, itseems to do so \'down a long hallway, darkly\' -- that is to say, itfeels distant.George C Scott does a pretty darned good job with the lead character.Great actors never fail to elevate a movie. There\'s another fineperformance put in by David Hemmings (Who I\'d never seen before, and Ilearn from the IMDb database died in 2003) as the \'rummy\' named Eddy.The musical score is weird -- it really seems to stay with you afterthe movie is done. The previous commenter is correct -- the movie has adreamy feel to it. There\'s very little by way of violence (at least bytoday\'s standards). What little there is, at the end, is accompanied bygarishly bright and unrealistic blood.Nonetheless, check this film out. It\'s truly an interesting and funfilm.
