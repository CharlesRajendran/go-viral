It is a mystery. Or is it mind over matter? The power of a mysteriouspainting depicted in this timeless tale of Oscar Wilde\'s imagination --probing the depth of life\'s meaning.It\'s costume drama, story began in London 1886. Definitely has an elementofintrigue -- "a painting with a life of its own".  It\'s eerie. It\'sdramatic.Its theme is scary. Such is a "deadly" wish of the main character, DorianGray:"If only the picture (a portrait of Dorian Gray) can change, and I canalways be as I am now. I\'d give my soul for that." Dorian Gray\'s obsessionwith youth became eternal youth.Imagine that as time goes by, he will always stay the same rich attractiveyoung man that he is -- never grow old, while the picture will take on thechanges -- his soul and character. Conscience, no longer he has -- thepicture took it on. The story describes how Dorian Gray spends his lifehenceforth and the consequences that entail.A very young Angela Lansbury, after her debut in George Cuckor\'s 1944"Gaslight", portrays the innocent young actress Sibyl Vane from the poorside of town. The bet between the characters of George Sanders and HurdHatfield brought to mind the cruel intentions of Neil LaBute\'s 1997 "IntheCompany of Men". George Sanders is the cynical callous Lord Henry Wotton.The events all happen in a seemingly civil manner, immersed in the societyof the rich. Have and have-nots are juxtaposed.The film is essentially in Black and White, with only the specific contentof the picture of Dorian Gray in color when we see it through Dorian\'seyes.It\'s another B/W classics gem, well-cut and impeccably presented. Itencompasses sentiments and all elements: mystery, intrigue, love lost,friendships, regrets, and fear. Dorian Gray with a tormented inside --pining for the return of his soul. Is this the Devil\'s advocate? You seenohell depicted as in Vincent Ward\'s 1998 "What Dreams May Come", or WoodyAllen\'s 1997 "Deconstructing Harry" or Taylor Hackford\'s 1998 "The Devil\'sAdvocate". No glamorous, elaborate take on the Devil, but the atmosphereprovided that suggestion. There\'s no special effects, yet you can feel thetwistedness: a man asking for help within yet unable to help himselfbecausehe\'s a lost soul. The temperature of the movie seems like being in 10degreeCelsius -- cold in sentiment and tone. There was a glimmer of warmth -- itflickered and faded with the innocent Sibyl Vane character.The subject matter is timeless even though the film was made in 1945. Thestory is fascinating in spite of the pace which may not be at breakneckspeed as in today\'s action packed, sound effects filled movies.You can say it\'s pseudo sci-fi -- a foreboding tale it is. By and by,DorianGray\'s unchanging mask-like face reminds me of "Mr. Sardonicus" (WilliamCastle\'s 1961). His behaviors are no longer placid -- gradually turningintohideous evils. This film questions one\'s probity. The mystery of life istolive it not to attain immortality. How uninteresting it\'d be to bechangeless and ageless? (John Boorman\'s 1974 sci-fi "Zardoz" with SeanConnery and Charlotte Rampling came to mind). Growth and change areintrinsic elements of life. Life and death go hand in hand cyclically. Atruly worthwhile effort from writer/director Albert Lewin.
