Long live Harold! This is a charming silentcomedy where my hero plays a shy boy writinga book about the ways to seduce a woman. Hewants to publish it, but the editor thinksthis is a funny book.  In his way, Haroldfells in love with a beautiful young woman.This love helps him to stop being girl shy.Very funny gags, and also a sensitive wayto illustrate love (such beautiful scenesare frequents in Harold\'s movie). This isalso a great opportunity to see the beautyand the talent of the wonderful JobynaRalston.  See it! And see all the HaroldLloyd movies of the 1920\'s! He was and stillis one of the best comic actors in Hollywoodhistory.
