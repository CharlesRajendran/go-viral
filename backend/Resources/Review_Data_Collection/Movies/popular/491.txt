At seventy-seven minutes in length, "Picture Snatcher" contains justenough action and comedy to support this little trifle.Cagney is terrific as a former mobster who gets released from prisonand tries to make a go of it as a photographer for a local newspaperrag, which is edited by Ralph Bellamy.This film is from the first scene, where Cagney shows affection for theguards and warden, has a ridiculous story line all the way thru to theend. But it moves along at a breakneck pace and has several very goodperformances, so although we might know it\'s ridiculous, we reallydon\'t care.Alice White is terrific as a gun moll on the make for Cagney. Bellamyis good as Cagney\'s drunken editor.But the film belongs to Cagney, who turns in another terrific, under -appreciated performance.7 out of 10
