Carole's busy cleaning out her new husband, the always oafish NatPendleton, under the watchful but none-too-concerned eye of 'OfficeBoy' (who makes these names up?) played energetically by ChesterMorris. You don't have to be a neurosurgeon to see how this one endsup. Several of her husband's cronies have eyes for her and Chesterpretty much sits back and makes with the Jimmy Cagney-type wisecracksuntil he's inevitably needed to save Carole from the mess she'screated. Car nuts will like the scene at the Mercedes dealer whereshe's buying a 1934 540K Roadster (deliberately paying too much) andcringe over Pendleton testing the bulletproof aspects of his armoredlimo. Made at the dawn of the infamous Production Code, THE GAY BRIDEis a lot like Warner's pre-code program entries only with MGM's addedelement of class. Carole's a pro and Chester Morris rates an 'A' foreffort.
