Criminally underrated war picture details the adventures of a group ofWWI volunteer pilots whose excitement turns to anguish and despair whenthey are confronted with the reality of combat. Director Stuart Walkerhelms this unabashedly grim WWI drama with tact and honesty, featuringsome above average aerial footage and an unflinchingly blatant anti-warmessage that is still quite surprising and daring for a depression-erastudio film. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Fredric Marchdelivering a marvelously conflicted turn in the lead, and Cary Grant isconvincingly cast against type as a hot-headed, violent brute. Perhapsa bit too a head of it's time when originally released, THE EAGLE ANDTHE HAWK is a terrific film that is ripe for rediscovery.
