Silver Fleet made in 1943 is a great view.Set in Holland in a small shipbuilding town now controlled by the Nazisit is a tale of double intrigue and heroism that is surprisinglywatchable. The tale of the shipyard owner (Ralph Richardson) who isfriendly to the Nazis by day and a hero of another mettle by night isnicely done. What makes this work is the human aspects are not swept toone side but are tackled too.Ralph Richardson may never had the matin√©e idol looks of an Oliver buthe makes a very good and quite unassuming impact here, there is bothsuspense, adventure, and wry humour - this film is memorable and thecourage is more than propaganda. Richardson always did sneak up on youand here he does so well.All in heartily recommended.
