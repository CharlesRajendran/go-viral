Saw it last evening on TCM. Excellent performances by a stellar cast,filmed at a time when Hollywood and American movie audiences were fullyexperiencing World War 2 on the "home-front". This film has somehowmanaged to avoid becoming "dated" and remains entertaining, appealingand instructive to a contemporary audience. The story is primarilyabout a middle class family and its attempts to deal with problemscaused by the war. The characters are decent people confronted byissues that test their faith and ability to carry on with life in anormal way. I particularly enjoyed the performances of ClaudetteColbert and Monty Woolley, although the entire cast did excellent jobs.The music was appealing and appropriate and helped create the moodintended. TCM played the opening "Overture" which added to theproduction quality. Three hours is a long sitting but this one is worthit.
