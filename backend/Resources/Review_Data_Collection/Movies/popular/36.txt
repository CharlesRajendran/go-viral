This is a remake of the classic 1930' s movie The Four Feathers ,withdirectorial chores being split between Terence Young ( soon to be aJames Bond helmsman) and Zoltan Korda ,whose brother Alexander producedthe earlier version The movie is faithful both to the earlier pictureand the source novel by A E W Mason .It tells how Harry Faversham isunjustly accused of cowardice when resigning his commission in theBritish army on the eve of the war in the Sudan against the Mahdi (Fora fuller cinema treatment of the conflict see the Heston -Olivierpicture "Khartoum ") 3 of his friends and his fianc√©e hand him whitefeathers ,emblematic of cowardice .Faversham disappears from Londonsociety and travels to Africa and disguises himself as a native ,inwhich role he comes to the aid of one of his accusers Their is a slightly cheapskate air about the production whose battlescenes are largely taken from footage shot for the earlier movie .Theacting is pretty wooden -espaecially from Anthony as Faversham andLaurence Harvey as his chief accuser .The peppy cameo from JamesRobertson Justice as a crusty old general adds needed vigour to theacting department as does a pre Hammer movies Christopher Lee as anative tribesman The movie is not downright bad but it lacks the brioand pace that would have lifted it a notch or two higher and overall iscompetent but slightly plodding
