I enjoyed this movie very much. Considering it is a B-movie, in myopinion, it is a good B-movie. It is based on the mystery novel "TheMystery of Hunting\'s End" by Mignon G. Eberhart, and the movie title"Mystery House" is very appropriate, since a group of people aregathered together in a house where a man was murdered. The acting bythe entire cast is good. With the exception of Dick Purcell and AnnSheridan, I was not familiar with any of them. It is a short movie, butthere is much action in less than one hour. I would recommend thismovie to anyone who is interested in a good mystery movie. The hourwent by very fast.
