As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director/producer/playwright David Belasco transformed notorious society divorceeMrs. Leslie Carter into an international stage star) is certainly not in aleague with that other Warner\'s biopic of similar vintage, "Yankee DoodleDandy" (what is?), but "Lady" is an enjoyable film in its own right--ANDshares quite a few traits in common with the Cagney classic. Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair" brims over with old-time show-business flavor. (Among other things, both films featuredelicious theatrical boarding-house sequences as well as the inevitablescenes set backstage and in theatrical managers\' offices.) Also, in "Lady"as in the Cohan biopic, the supporting cast is made up of familiar andbeloved character actors of the period, all doing the sort of top-notchwork we remember them for. Need I add that, again like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair"doesn\'t let the truth get in the way of telling a good story? But, alsolike "Dandy," "Lady" does manage--gloriously!--to convey the esssence ofits show-business-giant hero\'s larger-than-life personality. Everyone knowsthat Cagney limned Cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionateportrayal in "Yankee Doodle Dandy"--but few moviegoers realize that ClaudeRains did a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair"--and did it with a panache that almost equals Cagney\'s.Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman\'s galvanicpersonality in all its outsized glory. Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable, superbly observed, and remarkably true-to-life performance as the man allBroadway once called "The Wizard." To watch Claude Rains in action (lookingin every shot as if he\'s having a helluva good time!) in "The Lady With RedHair" is to see David Belasco leap to life on film as if he can\'t wait toshake things up on the Main Stem once again.
