I haven\'t seen this film for many years, but the performances by EdnaMay Oliver and James Gleason are memorable. Miss Oliver\'s performancewas brilliant enough to command the release of other movies starringher as Hildegard Martha Withers. This group of movies also represented,I believe, an attempt by the studio to make Edna May Oliver (who wasnot British, by the way, but solidly American) a leading lady. Thatattempt failed, probably because she was not a sex symbol. But in thePenguin Pool Murder she wins over James Gleason by the sheer force ofher character, and when he finally succumbs she characteristicallyresponds, "I thought you\'d never ask!" Or perhaps she was not cast moreas a leading lady because she was, simply put, unsurpassed as acharacter actress. It isn\'t that she wasn\'t a box-office draw; for, asa gentleman who lived through the golden age of Hollywood once said tome, "Who didn\'t love Edna May Oliver !"
