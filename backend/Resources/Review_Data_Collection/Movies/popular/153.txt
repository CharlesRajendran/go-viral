Norma Shearer, still carrying torch for handsome Gordon, who died in WW1,marries another guy on the rebound, only to find that insanity runs in hisfamily and she can\'t have children with him (but how will she ever be themother of a son as handsome as dear, dead Gordon?), and she can\'t leavehimbecause the shock would certainly send him over the edge into terminalwacked-out nuttiness. What to do? Gimmick here is that, along with thespoken dialogue, we share the inner thoughts of the characters --presentedas V.O. while the actors stand around mute, making faces as if somebodyjustbroke wind on the set. Did anyone watch this with a straight face in 1932?Film goes on long enough that the sanity of the audience is tested muchmoreseverely than that of Shearer\'s husband, but was reportedly 5 or 6 hoursintheatrical production. (Any cries of "Author! Author!" at that premierecame, no doubt, from a lynch mob.) It\'s an MGM, so of course the cast isfirst-rate, but is it their fault the act is a louse?
