Even though Rudolph Valentino is billed as the lead (in the version Isaw, anyway) he is not on screen all that much and is more of asupporting character. It is really the story of Pere Grandet (wellplayed by Ralph Lewis) and how his life has been, figuratively andliterally, crushed by gold (the final scenes in which he is trapped inhis cellar with the ghosts of people his greed has destroyed and istaunted by a snake-armed, leering golden demon are very disturbing).Still, even though his role was comparatively small, Valentino makes astrong impression as Charles Grandet, the spoilt son of a rich manwhose essential decency, like that of Julio Desnoyer, is brought out byadversity and the love of a good woman . At the beginning of the moviehe is hosting a wild birthday party for himself, but twenty minutesinto the picture his father has committed suicide and Charles hasbecome dependent on his wealthy but miserly uncle, Pere Grandet . Athis uncle\'s home he meets and falls in love with his beautiful countrymouse of a cousin, Eugenie, played by Alice Terry whose etherealblondeness contrasts well with Valentino\'s dark good looks and who withthe possible exception of Vilma Banky was his most memorable leadinglady.Objections have been sometimes raised to the liberties thescreenwriter, June Mathis, took with Balzac\'s novel. A title card atthe beginning of the picture tells the audience that"commercialization" has told the producers that it dislike costumepictures; evidently commercialism also told them that audiences don\'tlike unhappy endings or unlikable leads, hence the sentimentalizing ofthe original story in which Charles Grandet and Eugenie are happilyreunited at the end of the film. In the novel, Charles wastes Eugenie\'sgold and quickly forgets about her (making her gift seem more rash thanromantic), and the conquering power does indeed turn out to be greed,not love as the movie would have it. If one is able to accept the movieon its own term (which of course can be difficult if you\'re familiarwith the original source), Mathis\'s changes work well enough, however.Other complaints about the movie have involved the disorienting changeof setting from Paris to the countryside--in the Paris scenes thepeople are dressed in modern (1920\'s) fashions, but the clothing andlifestyles of the country people has a very nineteenth century look tothem. It is conceivable, however, that in the days before modern mediahad permeated everywhere fashions in isolated villages would changemore slowly.On the whole, this is one Valentino\'s stronger moviesÂ—it was a shamethat irreconcilable professional and personal differences between RexIngram and Valentino led to the latter\'s departure from Metro shortlyafterwards as there he was being offered the sort of quality scripts hewould spent the rest of his short career trying to find.
