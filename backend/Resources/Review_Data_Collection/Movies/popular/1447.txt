The story of "Lady Windemere's Fan" is a touching portrait ofrepression and hypocrisy in England during the Victorian era. Thepivotal character in the movie is the charming, mysterious wise andbeautiful middle-age woman played by Madeleine Carroll, who returns tothe conservative upper-class milieu that had banished and rejected herdecades ago. She manages to come to terms with the most delicate andunresolved aspects of her past, but she has to pay a very high pricefor that. Nevertheless, she is a survivor and in her eighties she willbe able to make a balance and reflect on that crucial episode of herpast. Madeleine Carroll and George Sanders are perfectly cast as themiddle-age charmers and schemers, and also sound believable as thefrail but smart octogenarian survivors, and deliver great performanceson the hands of Preminger, who is able to maintain a good rhythm and tocapture what we might figure is the Victorian society's aristocraticmilieu of gossips and intrigues. I also enjoyed Martita Hunt as atypical upper-class eccentric, manipulative and witty matron; andthought that both Richard Greene and Jeanne Crain were OK as theyounger Windemere couple. I think that this underrated little gemdeserves a wider distribution. I am very lucky that in Spain the DVD of"The Fan" has been released in September 2007.
