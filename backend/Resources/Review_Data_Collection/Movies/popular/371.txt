I caught this restored version of the 1920 German silent classic at LincolnCenter where a new musical score was premiered by the Chamber MusicSociety.I had never seen the film before and was frankly amazed at the imagery inthe sets and costumes and editing of the film. The film\'s director, PaulWegener, wearing a thickly padded outfit and wig and high-heeled bootsplaysthe main character, "The Golem". A mythical character from Jewish folklore.For its day, the special effects were also intriguing. I resist describingthe movie as anti-semitic but I believe that the portrayal of the jewishghetto was depicted so dramatically to show that the jews in Prague wereoutsiders and not welcome in mainstream society. This is evident in thefactthat when a nobleman comes to the ghetto, he is greeted by a mammoth closedgate that looks like a precursor to the one used in King-Kong.And most notably, during the creation sequence, a satanic figure appears onscreen that would coincide with the European belief a that time that Jewswalk hand-in-hand with the Dark forces.As far as the Golem\'s performance- this film is really a precursor to"Frankenstein" that Boris Karloff must have seen in its original release -there are so many similarites.Biggest Image - at the conclusion, the Golem is surrounded by a group of"blond" Aryan-looking children that clearly distinguish them from theghettochildren that we see earlier in the film.
