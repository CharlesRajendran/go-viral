Hoppy, California, & Johnny are all Texas Rangers (I guess they had veryloose hiring criteria if California got in!). Hoppy\'s dressed in all blackthroughout the film (this is important to those of us who know that hisblack outfit signifies "he means business" & his rancher\'s & other outfitssignify "he\'s only fooling around & trying to act like someone other than"Hoppy"). The setting is Silver Bullet, Texas, & no, The Lone Ranger is notin this movie, although practically everyone else is! George Reeves(Superman) is here; he plays a Mexican & is on screen for only a fewmoments. Duncan Renaldo (The Cisco Kid) is here, & has a nice role as aMexican police commandant. Robert Mitchum plays his usual (for his earlydays in the westerns) baddie. Claudia Drake actually has a more significantrole in the film than anyone other than Hoppy himself. There\'s good action(4 gunfights), good humorous situations, & overall it\'s quite nicely done,with good production values. I rate it 8/10.
