The name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was allabout, so I taped this film during the early hours of the AM. If youever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early daysand actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men.This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can worktogether and be friends after WW I and how the Germans came to the aidof the French miners much to the unbelief of the French townsfolk. Theactors were all outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with ahorse and a small young boy who worked in the mine. There is an old oldretired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when theelevator breaks down. If you are a real film buff, this is a film youwill not want to miss.
