Okay, it is very possible to quibble with this film if you are toowrapped up in political correctness. Sure, it's a real shame that thefilm starred the white actor, Richard Dix, in dark paint as the Indianlead in the film. However, having White actors play Indians was prettymuch the rule up to the 1960s, so I could easily overlook this. And,the beginning of the film can seem a tad preachy and irrelevant (thoughI liked it, Leonard Maltin's Guide knocked this section of the film).However, given that the film was made in the rather racist 1920s (whenthe KKK was on the rise and one of the strongest political forces inAmerica), it is a truly amazing and transcendent film that definitelydeserves to be seen and appreciated. Unlike the typical cowboy movie of the day, the Indians in the film areneither blood-thirsty savages nor are they simple-minded. Instead, theare uniformly shown as decent Americans who want a fair shake and apart of the American Dream. In fact, their desire to become TRUEAmericans and their love of their country make this a great patrioticfilm. While based on all the horrible injustices they received in thefilm, their fundamental decency seems amazing.In addition to excellent acting, writing and direction, specialattention must be focused on the spectacular and breathtakingcinematography--especially towards the beginning of the film. Thescenes of the Grand Canyon are among the most beautiful ever filmedduring the silent era and are in many ways reminiscent of movingversions of Ansel Adams photos. The film is a true work of art.
