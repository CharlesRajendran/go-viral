When I see these old attempts at what amounted to a horror film backthen, before my time and I\'m an old duffer, I\'m always struck at themarvelous Gothic quality wrought by the twisted buildings, the gnarledstairways, the open balconies and the weird angles of things such asdoorways, arches, street, bridges and the like. The monstrosities arestark, hardly terrifying by today\'s CGIs and often terrifying theirvictims in an almost comical, stylized way. This marvelous filmtogether with Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are marvelouspieces of art. There is an ageless quality to them that transcends thehoary and often corny plots and acting. Each must be taken as a wholebecause that product is always greater than the sum of their parts.Compare the magical Indian Love Call of Nelson Eddy and JeanetteMacDonald, two rather mainstream singers whose voices blend intosomething greater than either of their individual talents. So too itis, I contend, with these old Gothic classics. Horror? Hardly. But,their starkness and darkness with its twisted surroundings are stilleerie and provoking.
