         In the lower-class section of New York lives theKramdenfamily: Ralph and wife Alice. Upstairs are their neighbors andgoodfriends Trixie and Ed Norton. Ralph works as a bus driver while Edisa sewer worker. Alice and Trixie are homemakers. One thing\'s forsure:Alice is tough. She would never call Ralph "sir". Whenever Ralphwouldrant and rave and threaten to punch her to the moon, she isn\'tthetiniest bit offended.         Ralph and Ed always dabble into "get rich quick" schemesandall of them seem to back fire. Like the one where Alice takes in adog,unbeknownst to Ralph, who eats a mysterious meat from therefrigerator.Not knowing it\'s dog food, he tries to market the stuff. Once hefindsout it\'s dog food, he goes ballistic. Or how about the episodewhereRalph thinks somebody is stalking him? He sees a painter on thefireescape, and it takes a minute or two to sink in, then he freaksout.Funny!! Remember the one where Alice goes out to get a job andRalphstays home to tend to the house, due to the bus depot was layingoffemployees for the week.       The Honeymooners started as a segment on The Jackie GleasonShow,but then became a TV smash-hit! Jackie Gleason plays RalphKramden,Art Carney is Ed Norton, Audrey Meadows is Alice and Joyce RandolphisTrixie. Trixie wasn\'t as major of a character as Ralph, Ed andAlice.She wasn\'t always in every episode. Sadly, Jackie Gleason is nolongerwith us, but Carney, Meadows and Randolph are still around,appearingon talk shows, sharing what they remember about The Honeymooners.       In 1960, The Honeymooners inspired The Flintstones! FredandBarney behave just like Ralph and Norton, whom I think werederivativefrom Laurel & Hardy, two other very funny guys! HoneymoonersbegatThe Flintstones and The Flinstones, apparently, begat The SimpsonsandThe Simpsons begat many, many comedies we see today. Honeymooners,muchlike I Love Lucy and Father Knows Best, will forever live on inreruns,and in our memories. Memorable quotes:Ralph: "Norton, you\'re a mental patient!"   Norton: "Ralphie boy,you\'rea nut."   Ralph: "Ooh, Alice, one of these days: bang! Zoom!Straightto the moon!"-
