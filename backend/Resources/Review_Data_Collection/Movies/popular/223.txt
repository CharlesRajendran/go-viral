I haven\'t seen this movie since I was a child. I wish I knew where andwhen this would be seen again - or, if I can get it on VHS or DVD. Iused to watch it on local television with my sisters and this one wasalways a favorite. I especially loved watching movies about familiesand how everyone got along. Because this movie was about troubled kids,I found it very entertaining. One of my favorite scenes in this movie,and one that made me shed a tear, was the one about the Eagle Scoutaward for Jimmy John and when he gave the rose to his mother. It was sogood! If you want to watch a feel good movie, this is a great one. Itshows the closeness of family and how they can overcome obstacles.
