I have never seen a 1930\'s American film like this one!  Perhaps this isbecause it was directed by German director William Dieterle when he wasfresh off the boat. Apart from a slightly pontifical doctor musing about thedifficulties of war-time flyers adjusting to civilian life near thebeginning of the film, this is a subtle, evocative, under-stated andpowerful depiction of this mal-adjustment.  Following the end of World WarOne a group of American flyer buddies go on a six months long bender inParis and Lisbon.  They link up with a rich young woman, beautifully playedby Helen Chandler, who drinks as hard as they do.  They are all a little inlove with death and wander from one meaningless adventure to another inpursuit of it.  It is here that the film encounters some difficulties -making meaninglessness dramatically interesting is verydifficult.But the actors do an admirable job in suggesting the huge pain under thejovial partying.  Richard Barthelmess was one of the greatest screen actorsever, and his talents are well utilised here.  Johnny Mack Brown is arevelation as the rougher Bill - who knew this cowboy star was such a fineactor?  David Manners is also a surprise, much better here than in"Dracula", he proves to be capable of doing great emotional work.  ElliottNugent as the heavily traumatised Francis is unforgettable, and Walter Byronis fine as an unscrupulous hanger-on.This is not a perfect film, but it is a brave one, and is absolutelyessential to an understanding of the mood after World War One.  It is nosurprise that the writer was also responsible for "Wings" (1927) - hisunderstanding of the relationships between men in and after wartime isphenomenal.  Make sure you see it.
