OK, so this is as hokey as they come, but really sort of enjoyable.Jeff York as Li\'l Abner is good, and Martha O\'Driscoll as Daisy Mae isbeautiful, so how can you go wrong? This film spends about the first 30 minutes establishing the locationsand characters, and the final 43 minutes resolving the (thin) plotstructure that revolves around both a Sadie Hawkins day race andEarthquake McGoon\'s capture and subsequent escape. The final 10 minutesare really fast paced with Wendy Wildcat and Daisy chasing after poorL\'il Abner as he attempts to evade marriage. Hey, not a classic, but not bad either.
