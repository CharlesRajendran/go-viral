This film has recently been restored to a 35mm print. I was fortunateenough to see it. A great deal is already said here about JeanneEagels\' performance. The only thing I can add is that Bette Davis seemsto not have so much modeled her performance in the remake, as to havemodeled her own physical persona in general on Eagels, who has a subtlebody twitch that Davis took to (delightful) extremes later on.Certainly Davis would have seen this original movie version, and mayhave even seen Eagels on stage in other properties.The sound is very primitive in this early version. At first it seemedlike the sound wasn\'t even working. But the problem is that there is nosound until the film gets to a scene that has dialogue. It would havebeen interesting to hear more ambient sound added so you would be lesslikely to notice the old-fashioned audio, but then purists mightcomplain.Nevertheless, the film is fascinating and so is Eagels. I saw the filmwith an Asian friend who liked the fact that the film doesn\'t shirkfrom racism. The sequence where the heroine delivers the letter to thedragon lady was fun to compare to the later version. The early versionis a lot racier! Also, I must point out that Herbert Marshall, whoappears in the later version as the heroine\'s husband, is very youngand handsome as her murdered lover in this 1929 production.
