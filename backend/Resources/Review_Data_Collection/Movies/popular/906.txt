I just loved this movie. It kept my interest in a most peculiar way,and it took me nearly to the end of the picture before I figured itout. None of the key scenes were ever emphasized with dramatic musicswelling up, down, or out....anywhere. In fact, it did not have anymusic except for the piano playing in one scene. Most unusual. Thismovie came across almost as "play-like", without the typical "movie"accents. Very different, very good. The only drawback, if you canreally call it that, was the distraction of James Mason made up to be aman much older than his original years when he made this. The make upartist utilized a lot of "spirit-gum" that was used around his face,and unfortunately, it is noticeable in many scenes. But don't let thatdeter you from seeing this wonderful film!
