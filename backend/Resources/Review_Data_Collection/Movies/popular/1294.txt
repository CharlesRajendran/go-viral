This is a different war movie, it has very few action sequences.  But thedirector created a compelling movie none the less.  Most action in thismovie takes place off camera, this creates a feeling of \'being there.\' Onecharacter mentions that all the action he has seen he had to listen to it.The pace of the movie tends to get slow then speed up quickly.  It wasquitedifferent but for a war movie fan like myself, very entertaining.
