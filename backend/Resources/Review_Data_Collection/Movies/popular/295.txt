One of the most interesting of the Fox pre-code talkies, for severalreasons: 1) It has nice girl Frances Dee as a perverse and masochisticsociety miss, snarling and hip-shaking and shocking the elite. 2) Ithas Judith Anderson, in a swell backless evening gown, playing a moll,against-the-grain casting of the most inspired sort, even if the movienever explains her high-tone Brit accent vs. her brother's AmericanMidwest elongated vowels. (She also played a gangster years later in"Lady Scarface," but it's a much less interesting film.) 3) You get tosee Blossom Seeley, the great vaudevillian, sob a couple of torchsongs, and she's the real thing. 4), and most fascinatingly: GeorgeBancroft plays a no- better-than-he-should-be bail bondsman who worksboth sides of the street and is terribly corrupt, yet the movie likeshim, we like him, and he doesn't have to repent for it. It's lively andviolent and funny, and, unlike so many Fox early talkies, it has thefast pace of a good Paramount or Warners flick from the same period.
