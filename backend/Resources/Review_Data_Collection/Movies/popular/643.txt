I find the movie aptly named. My motivation for responding is due to anearlier opinion on this movie, specifically: "the central character ofDelilah is the worst kind of racial stereotype; a relentlessly cheerfulmammy, perfectly satisfied to spend her life tending to the needs ofher white employer". I am an American Black (African-American) and I donot find Delilah offensive. In fact I applaud the reflection of honestythat this 1934 film attempts. The "mammy" of that time period had veryfew choices. That she was happy to help her very nice white employerfor the safety provided does not make for a hate figure by Blacks. Itmakes for a reminder of the intense level of crap Black folks wentthrough and how they dealt with the pain of it to stay honest, kind andhelpful people. Should Delilah lived in the streets and hated whitepeople the rest of her life? Should she have not had the fortitude andinsight to find a situation with another caring human being, albeitthis other human was white? And for this she is lauded as a the worstkind of racial stereotype? No. The answer is a resounding NO. Now ifDelilah was beaten and raped on a regular basis and still wanted toplease her white employer while denying her race the previous posterwould have had a point.Okay, I really didn\'t like the mournful gospel music, R&B would havemade this movie perfect to me but that\'s just me. Live and Love. Thereis no shame in being a good person.
