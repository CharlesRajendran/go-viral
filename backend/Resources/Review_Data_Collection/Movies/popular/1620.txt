Although the story is derivative of Hemingway\'s The Sun Also Rises",novelist and screenwriter John Monk Saunders brings his own style and abetter plot to this study of the "Lost Generation" wandering Europe duringthe 1920\'s.The male characters desperately cling to drinking and all-night frivolityasa means of forgetting the terror of war, and they meet a similarly lost,though full of life, alcoholic woman played superbly by the under-ratedHelen Chandler.  Chandler\'s performance is so effortless that she seems tobe playing herself, a woman living an independent, wild life with anunknownreason for also wanting to forget and escape.  Watch her scene with RichardBarthelmess as they have a drink at a cafe during a rain shower beforevisiting a cemetery, and you\'ll see her longingly trying to imagine asimpler, happier life.Barthelmess provides another expert performance to the film, as one of thesaner, less-hard-drinking characters who half-heartedly tries to escapefromthe others on several occasions, but is always drawn back because of hislove and friendship for the others.See this film if you can - it\'s unlike any other.
