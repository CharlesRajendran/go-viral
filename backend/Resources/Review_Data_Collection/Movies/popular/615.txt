When LI\'L ABNER was made, in 1940, Al Capp\'s comic strip of the samename was one of the U.S.\'s favorites, with his hayseed creation findinghimself in one jam after the other, without trying at all. A story byCapp is the foundation for this film, which holds a unique spot incinema history, as it is the only attempt to precisely recreate comicillustration, utilizing makeup, costumes and exact phrasing (withoutinterpretation). The plot and subplots generally revolve about theannual Sadie Hawkins Day celebration in Dogpatch, which presents areafemales with just about their only opportunity to catch a husband, byliterally running down and snaring one of the town\'s fleeing bachelors.For those who remember the silent film era, this effort provides smallroles for many pre-talkie stalwarts, including Buster Keaton, EdgarKennedy, Chester Conklin, Al St. John, Lucien Littlefield, Hank Mannand Edward Brady. At times very reminiscent of Capp\'s drawing, the verytall Jeff York, billed as Granville Owen, is effective as Abner. MarthaO\'Driscoll, Kay Sutton and Billie Seward, as the three women mostvigorously seeking marriage with Abner, do their hearty best with thethin scenario. More silly than cute, this picture is not marked byoutstanding work from cast and crew, its significance coming only fromthe mentioned verisimilitude.
