OK,  so it\'s the old story about what goes on backstage in the productionof aBroadway musical----even to the clich√© of the star getting sick and theunderstudytaking her place and becoming a big star.  Many critics see this as theinspiration for42nd STREET, but this film has the period charm that only the transitionaltalkiemusicals could have.  Part of it is  quite stagebound-----includingmusicalnumbers asyou probably would have seen them on the Broadway stage in the 1920\'s, soifyoudon\'t care for very early musicals, you\'d better pass on this one.This was the film that introduced the song "Am I Blue" sung by a veryyoungEthel Waters, and followed by the even better "Birmingham Bertha"  withblackdancer John Bubbles.  You should be warned that there are black dancers inthe castwho wear some outrageous politically incorrect costumes---including onenumberwhere their costumes have watermelon stripes on them!  And seeing Joe E.Brownas a mean comedian who constantly argues with Arthur Lake (better knownasDagwood Bumstead in the BLONDIE Series) will be something of a revelationtohis fans.  The film was made in the early two-strip Technicolor process,whichunfortunately has yet to be found, but is still quite enjoyable in B & W.Remember,although this is a very charming transitional talkie musical, modernaudiences willonly see it as a horribly dated antique.
