This is a mostly forgotten film today, though it deserves to be seen.It bears a lot of similarity to the great All Quiet on the WesternFront (1930) in that the film is meant to warn against the horrors ofwar instead of glamorize it.Frederick March does an excellent job in portraying a troubled WW1 ace.Despite his success, he can't seem to forget that each victory equalshim killing another human being. This inner turmoil continuesthroughout the film and climaxes when he is given yet another accolade.I don't want to spoil the film by revealing what happens next. But, itcame as a bit of a surprise! The ending clearly makes the movie.By the way, the VCR box cover shows Cary Grant. Yes he was an importantsupporting actor in this movie, but considering March's performance, itis a darn shame they are trying to capitalize on Grant and not March.PS--if you liked this film, try watching the hard to find ACE OF ACES,starring Richard Dix. It's very similar except that Dix is a pacifistwho only reluctantly goes to war. Once he becomes a pilot, unlikeMarch, he finds he LOVES killing and his personality changesdramatically! A truly unusual film.
