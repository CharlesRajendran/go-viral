We all project ourselves into the books we read and films we see, sothe more closer to our lives the entertainment vehicle is, the greaterthe experience and enjoyment. So I suppose this film would have justbeen another oater for me but for that one small detail.The Outriders was a typical late \'40s western movie, so the only reasonI decided to watch it was that I like Joel McRea. Otherwise I mighthave passed on this 55 year old sage brush saga. But once it started,the female lead, Arlene Dahl, caught my eye.Ms. Dahl could have been just another late 1940s blonde, blue eyedmovie star in another late 1940s oater except for two things. first,she looked uncannily like my high school sweetheart (I know, everyonehas an old high school sweetheart-go watch American Graffiti) but shereally did look like her. And secondly, she spoke softly and moved,glided across the stage, just like *** did.Then the story line somewhat mirrored the relationship we had. A toughand dangerous outlaw meets a sweet, honest and stunning beauty. I letmyself slip into the fantasy of this movie figuring it would be a nicebit of nostalgic escapism. but then came the dance scene during thewagon train\'s stop on its overland journey. Head honcho Will Owens (McRea) tells Jen Gort (Ms. Dahl) to stay in thewagon to avoid getting the trail hands stirred up, but when the menbreak out fiddles and guitars and start singing around the camp fire,she comes out, dressed to the nines with her dancing shoes. Jen glideseffortlessly across the camera\'s view and dances with all the men,politely and dignified, yet strikingly alluring and all woman. But what touched me was when she told Will Owens "you wanted me themost". No modern day tawdriness; nor erotic film scene with naked,sweating bodies could convey the message any clearer than her voice,her eyes and those words. It took me back.This film may just be another fast paced western to most, but to me itis **** and me. I miss her.
