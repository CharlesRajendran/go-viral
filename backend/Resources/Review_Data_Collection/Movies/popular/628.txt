Enjoyable noir outing enlivened by a first rate cast, solid script andtypically solid Alton camerawork.  O\'Keefe is right at home as Joe, thehotheaded lug with his own code and unlucky streak.  Trevor is at herfatalistic best as the true blue moll who is meant for him but gets steppedover.  Hunt is appealing and credible as the fresh-faced moralist who triesto change Joe but winds up changed, instead.  Burr is an effective heavy,albeit a bit too wimpy at the end.  Toomey, Bissell, and Ireland are allcompetent as well.  Alton uses multiple familiar Malibu locations to good advantage.  Thecinematography is excellent.  The script is particularly effective, building as Joe slowly discovers howhe has been set up and deceived by basically everyone to some degree. Claire Trevor\'s struggle to come clean at the end is a moving andsuspenseful section and the violent climax is curiously redeeming andsatisfying.  Noir fans should definitely give this one a look- not as famousas your typical Bogey or Mitchum entry, but just as iconic in its ownway.
