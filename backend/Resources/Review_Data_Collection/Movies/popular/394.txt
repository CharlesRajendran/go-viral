This one has a special place in my memories ! I grew up in New Mexiconear the desert, and whenever they showed this one on the late nightscience fiction Saturday night TV thriller show, I was afraid to walkto school and back on Monday! As I have grown up over the last fortyyears, I have come to appreciate it as a well crafted science fictionnear classic! Jack Arnold directed many good sci-fi movies in the1950\'s, but there is no doubt this was the creepiest! Next to thesuperior "THEM", released the year before (at a different studio), thisUNIVERSAL STUDIOS chiller was , for my money, the second best of thegiant bug movies of that decade! You will never look at the desert thesame way again. Actress MARA CORDAY impressed me so much in this one,that I named one of my daughters after her! JOHN AGAR gave a greatperformance, and this one led to him doing a string of more horror andsci-fi movies for the next decade or two! It helped that they used areal Tarantula (named TOMORROW), instead of a fake one, and CliffordStine\'s special effects will convince you that spider is really 100feet tall! Another plus is Henry Mancini wrote some of the music score!So, I recommend this one to all those that hate creepy crawlers of anykind! Get out the can of RAID! But, you had better make it a really bigcan !!!Signed, Baron Beast
