Although suspiciously short (I have viewed the truncated Americanrelease,at about an hour and a half long) Pabst\'s dour film is still fascinating towatch.Young Greta (Greta Garbo) contemplates prostituting herself to save herfamily from starvation during WW1 Vienna.Although woefully incomplete, Pabst is well-served by the best Europeansilents cast.  Werner Krauss is on lascivious best-form as the avaraciousbutcher.  The great Danish actress Asta Nielsen might be improbable castingas the daughter of a middle-aged couple (she was 44 at the time), butexudessympathy.  There is also a lovely cameo from Valeska Gert as the coat-shopassistant, who tempts Garbo into buying a fur coat after stroking her faceand body with it.It\'s all eyes on Garbo however, who gives a soulful, world-wearyintensity, shot in adoring close-up, as the troubled girl.  Hertransmissionof feelings of angst and desperation are hard to compare in silent cinemaand this ranks amongst her best ever.  (Indeed, it was her favourite film).There are improbable moments - Garbo as "Flaming Youth" doesnt work asshemakes the most gawky flapper and Einar Hanson as the Yankee Lieutenant whosaves her from despair is a hollywood happy ending out of kilter with \'TheNew Objectivity\' that Pabst claimed to work under.But his eye for a dank, semi-expressionistic Vienna is remarkable and themobile camera he employs at several key moments (notably as it rovesamongstthe butcher\'s queue like an interrogating spot-light) are almostrevelatory.
