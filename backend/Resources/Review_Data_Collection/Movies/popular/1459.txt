Until recently I had never heard of this little gem of British holidaysentiment. I heard someone call it the "Christmas movie for people who don\'tlike Christmas movies" and the quest to find it was on.This is the story of a Christmas in which the emotionally wounded family ofa Church of England clergyman come home and attempt to have a happy holiday.What happens is not your typical happy tearjerker, nor is it a Christmasnightmare. Its a reasonably realistic, as much as films of the time could bein 75 minutes, look at a family of emotional cripples as they all try to puttheir lives back on track. The ending while hopeful is far from certain, somuch so that I cursed the fact that it didn\'t go on another five or sixhours, my sole complaint about the film.A word of warning, don\'t abandon the film until you get to the end. I wasn\'tenraptured of the film for almost two thirds of its running time. I wasinterested in what was happening but I didn\'t know if I liked it, and thensuddenly all of the pieces were in place and it became this charmingatypical jewel of a movie.Forget Its a Wonderful Life, watch this instead, its so much more real.
