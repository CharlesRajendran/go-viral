John Ford directs a screwball comedy?? He does and quite well I may say.This is a story of a meek mild manner clerk named Ferguson(Robinson) whoalways gets stepped on and used. One day he is mistaken for "KillerMannion". Mannion is a mean ruthless gangster who cares for no one. Fergusonis a sweet kind man who cares for beautiful Wilhelmina(played by JeanArthur). Thanks to a police screwup, Mannion knows about Ferguson and is outto use him. The script is cute and funny. It\'s also good in setting up the situation andthe development of characters. It is not one of the best comedy ever made,but it is still very entertaining. The cast is first rate. Edward G does aterrific job at playing both the good AND the bad guy. Jean Arthur is funnyas Eddie\'s wise cracking co-worker(check her out playing the "gangstermoll"!) The other supporting characters are good too. The special effectsshowing both Robinsons on screen is quite good for it being 1935.If you get a chance to see it, please do. It is a very cutefilm.
