Ann Sothern and Franchot Tone are a young married couple in "Fast andFurious" which also stars Allan Joslyn, Ruth Hussey, and Mary BethHughes. A friend hits lawyer Joel Sloane (Tone) up for a loan tofinance a beauty pageant taking place at a resort and invites Sloaneand wife Garda (Sothern) to come see the show. After they arrive, theboss of the operation is murdered, and Joel's friend is jailed onsuspicion. It's up to Joel to stop looking at the bathing suitedbeauties and solve the case.This is a routine film, rather slow, with some nice humor. Tone andSothern are a delightful couple. This is the earliest film in whichI've seen Ann Sothern, whom I remember from her TV series as a child.She's gorgeous! A real knockout. She and Tone have the charm andlightness necessary for their roles; it's a shame they couldn't havehad a better script.Though this is directed by Busby Berkeley, there are no flashy dancenumbers but he does regale us with some neat camera work.A very pleasant film.
