Instead of repeating all the details others have, I\'ll just say thefilm really gave me the creeps the first time I saw it. Sometimes whenyou see an old movie like this from the 20s or 30s, it\'s tempting tothink nothing in it can shock you, because movies are not as"sophisticated" as the things you see today. I saw it on televisionmany years back, way before home video, and was delighted to find it ina grocery store\'s previously viewed tape bin. It hasn\'t lost any ofit\'s punch. To see how cruelly Lugosi dealt with his very helplessvictims chilled me to the bone. The Uday of his time. It has aHitchcock-type of human horror that is more effective than any rubbersuited monster. Not too badly paced, and is still one I get out when inthe mood for something dark.
