An eccentric hypochondriac staying at an Arizona dude ranchfinds the time - when not popping pills - to make a littleWHOOPEE!The emergence of two diverse talents make watching thisfilmspecial. Banjo-eyed Eddie Cantor, already the darling oftheZiegfeld Follies, became a fully fledged movie star in this taleofutter lunacy, his own special brand of innocent insanitycompletely at home in these surroundings. Never still forlong,legs & hands constantly flittering about, he punctuateseverydouble entendre with eyes rolled up as if in mild shock at hisowndialogue. His handful of songs, including his signaturetuneÂ‘Making Whoopee,\' only further showcase his abundant talent.This was also the first significant assignment for choreographerBusby Berkeley. He displays his genius in embryo with hisprecision movements (greatly influenced by his exposuretomilitary drills) and initial examples of his trademarkoverheadshots. The film\'s production entirely in early TechnicolorgaveBerkeley a rich palette with which to work and he acquitshimselfwell, even if his Indian maiden costumes near the end ofthepicture exhibit rather dubious taste.Cantor dominates the cast, but Ethel Shutta has a few goodmoments as Eddie\'s stern nurse and elderly Spencer Charters,playing the ranch\'s owner, has a hilariously bizarre sequenceinwhich he & Cantor examine each other\'s surgical scars.Moviemavens will recognize a young, uncredited Betty Grable asthechorus girl with the lasso in the first song.A glance down the credits shows a couple of names of note:NacioHerb Brown was among the foremost movie songwriters oftheera; Greg Toland would later be hailed as one of Hollywood\'sfinest cinematographers.The film makes a point of dealing with bias against NativeAmericans. Cantor\'s blackface comedy sequence will thenperhapsbe a bit of a surprise to some, but it should be rememberedthatthis sort of racial insensitivity was not unusual in themovieindustry of 1930.
