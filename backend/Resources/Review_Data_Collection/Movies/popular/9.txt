An average, very English fifties comedy, set on a freightship.Nevertheless this movie offers two outstanding dimensions: the first isleading man Dirk Bogarde, who plays with his usual excellence.The second is Brigitte Bardot, adding much charm by herEnglish-with-a-French-accent.By the way, the English film crew did a magnificent job on Brigitte: outofthe many thousand of shots spanning her entire career, those from \'DoctoratSea\' are among the very best. For this reason alone it is really worthwatching this movie.
