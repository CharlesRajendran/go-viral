I HAVE TO seriously differ with the same review of this gem of a film.Agreed that George Sanders is wonderful (as usual) and that thebookends of the film are not necessary though rather charming, but thefilm is a jewel, all the performances are very good and MADELEINECARROLL in her last film ever is totally wonderful and EXQUISITE..Jeanne Crain does a credible job playing a British aristocrat, accentand all and Martita Hunt as always steals every scene she is in. Thesets and costumes are stunning, and it is a pity it was not filmed incolor. Otto Preminger is a strange choice as a director for thisvehicle but he is always fascinating, even his misfires and thiscertainly is NOT one of them.A must see believe me.....
