This is a wonderful pre-code pot-boiler with sterling performances fromit\'slead players, plenty of action and the man "You Love to Hate" Eric vonStroheim, at his most repellent best.Look out for the outstanding shower scene for Lilly Damita, and listen tothe sonorous magic of Laurence Olivier\'s voice, both reason enough towatchthis little-known piece.At 64 minutes, the most fun you can have in an hour of black andwhite.
