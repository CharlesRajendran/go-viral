I have loved this Cary Grant movie since the very first time I saw iton TV as a child growing up in Brooklyn. I can honestly say I watchedit every single time I saw it was listed in the TV Guide. It is a sweethonest tale filled with humor and humanity. It is a family movie but itis also very adult. I love all the characters and it touches on so manyhuman values for such a rather simple story that it is very much likereal life. I felt then, as I do now, that I was richer for having seenit. It evokes the same kind of emotion that I would get from watching"It's a Wonderful Life" although... if memory serves... I believe I sawthis movie long before I first saw that Christmas classic. If I wereprogramming for a local TV station or a network I would purchase therights to this movie (it's probably in public domain anyway) and showit all night on Christmas eve cause it not only has a beautifullypoignant and funny Christmas scene but it more importantly embodies allof the values that the holiday season is suppose to be about. I wouldprobably still watch it every single time. I loved it.
