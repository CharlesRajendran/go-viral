Of the six or so films Frank Fay made under his early-talkie Warnercontract, half wasted time presenting him as some sort of great lover.Battling this concept takes effort and a lapse in sense, not only by theaudience, but by the casts of these pictures.  This is especially true ofTHE MATRIMONIAL BED, is less a problem in BRIGHT LIGHTS, but might havereached the ludicrous in GOD\'S GIFT TO WOMEN if not for the sensationalwomen involved.  Cast as a descendant of Don Juan (annoyingly called"Toto"), it is a testament to the female talent that there is still a lotoffun to be had despite the fact that Frank Fay seldom shut\'s his mouth.Though the script hardly gives anyone a chance, Fay\'s incessant chattering"style" is only matched once, when the savvy Joan Blondell fairly burstsinto the man\'s boudoir -- a brief example of sophisticated bedroom farce.This sequence is followed by another gem, a most unexpected three-waybattleover Fay; a sexy brawl taking place atop his bed involving ALLQUIET/WESTERNFRONT\'S buxom Yola D\'Avril, Miss Blondell, and the legendary andstunninglygorgeous Louise Brooks. Yes, Louise was thrown to the dogs in talkingpictures, but here is one time (albeit sans bangs) where she looked andsounded sensational for the few moments we were allowed to see her. Nicemoments, too, by perfectly capable, delightful silent players: SUNRISEvampMargaret Livingston, who turns up to give leading lady Laura La Plante arough moment. La Plante is lovely, and fully up to the challenge of soundcomedy. Though hams abound, Alan Mowbray (as the butler), Tyrell Davis(managing to out-fey even Frank Fay), and the fabulous if underusedCharlesWinninger manage quite effectively.  Merely in it for Louise Brooks (and Ican\'t say as I blame you)?  Advance to the bedroom romp, but watch thewomencavort throughout the opening nightclub sequence -- there are enoughglimpses to satisfy.  Watch for the beautiful twins from Universal\'s KINGOFJAZZ, the "Sisters G," both of whom are coiffed in what seems to be LouiseBrooks\' old hairstyle.
