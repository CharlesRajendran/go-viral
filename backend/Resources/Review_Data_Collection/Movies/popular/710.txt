\'Bhowani Junction\' was one of the few movies where Ava Gardner was allowedto be more than just a beautiful, but inanimate statue.  As VictoriaJones,she emotes in ways that one rarely sees her do.  Like her character Juliein\'Showboat\' Victoria is bi-racial, which is the main theme of the movie.ThePakistani backdrop is gorgeously photographed and it\'s certainly atestamentto location shooting as opposed to studio backdrops.  Unsurprisingly, itwaswell directed by Cukor, especially the interior, dramatic scenes that heisso famous for.  The final sequence is a break from that, however, withdarkly lit chases and murder.  An entertaining diversion; certainly onethatfans of Gardner would want to catch.
