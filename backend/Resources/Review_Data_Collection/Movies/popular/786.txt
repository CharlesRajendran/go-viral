A great movie by a great director in a unique creative state of grace.Some of the scenes are pure poetry: the sudden change from b/w tocolour picture (underlined by a moving music score), the dramaticconclusion of a night out in Piazza di Spagna, the overall feeling ofnostalgia permeating the entire movie. Yes, this is a movie that willage like good wine. You can grow old with this movie, watch out not becaught too much into its spires of nostalgia. Just glance at VittorioGassman last, defeated, cynical look in his face, here the actor andthe man are one and the same. The rest of the cast are just aseffective and well sorted, nothing is out of place, the synergy betweenManfredi, Satta-Flores, Sandrelli, and the great Aldo Fabrizi will keepyou enthralled. Simply cinematographic art at its best.
