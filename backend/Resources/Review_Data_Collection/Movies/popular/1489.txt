I saw this movie at the Stanford Theater, a restored small-town moviepalace of 1925. The Stanford only shows old classics, and often somefilms show up on the bill that sound completely unfamiliar, but soundlike they might be worth a look.Penguin Pool Murder is just such a film. When I reat a little bit aboutit, it didn\'t sound too interesting, but since I like the pre-codeperiod so much, and I\'d never seen an Edna Mae Oliver film before(other than a tiny snippet from Saturday Night Kid) I decided that Imight as well go and see it.PPM is a fast-paced and hilarious murder mystery, still as gleefullyenjoyable as it was upon it\'s first release. The lead character, schoolmarm Hildegarde Withers, is brilliantly portrayed by snappy, vivaciousand proper Edna Mae Oliver. I\'m sure some people might get annoyed byher high-toned and imperious British accent, but I loved it. It lentbuoyancy to her already top-notch dialogue.Despite it\'s status as a B-production (as opposed to a more prestigious"A" movie with more stars, more crowd scenes and an all-around biggerbudget), PPM is a movie that reflect\'s Hollywood\'s unending attentionto detail, high visual standards and emphasis on glamour wheneverpossible. Take for instance one of the first scenes: Mae Clarke in herposh boudoir, dressed in a shimmering evening gown, making a telephonecall and getting accosted by her husband. Later, when she visits theaquarium, she\'s swathed in an enormous fur collar and the chiquest ofclothes. Imagine how many depression-weary families went to see this,and the mother imagined herself with Clarke\'s clothes and figure. Dadcould fancy himself her husband, and the kiddies would be entertainedby the character\'s antics. This is, if any thing, a family in the bestsense of the word.Edger Kennedy has a small role in this, as the token blundering Irishcop. When I was a kid, I saw him perform his routines in the Our Gangshorts When the Wind Blows and The First Seven Years, and again as theantagonized street vendor in Duck Soup. Recently, I\'ve come to dislikehis "slow burn" technique, but I\'m starting to like it again. It\'s anacquired taste, that\'s for sure. Here, Kennedy the cop has a shavedhead, which I thought was a bit unusual.I hope this movie comes out on video and DVD so I can own it formyself. To my limited knowledge, it\'s still relegated to the vaults,with the likes of so many great movies. Some day, people will begin tohear more about Edna Mae Oliver and want to see her films. Penguin PoolMurder will surface and be enjoyed by a whole new legion of fans. Thatday will be a good day indeed.
