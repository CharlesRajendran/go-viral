I studied opera with Marjorie Lawrence in the 1970\'s and she was anincredible, vital, and exciting personality. She was larger than lifeand her presence dominated any gathering she attended.The movie captures many of her physical mannerisms. Her voice was mostsuited to the Wagnerian repertoire and the selection of the greatEileen Farrel to sing the more popular arias chosen for the film was anexcellent one. However, Miss Lawrence was disappointed that her ownvoice wasn\'t used as had been agreed, which I understand resulted in asettlement in her favor.Her husband, Doctor King, was an great gentleman and devoted to her.Following the years depicted in the film, she became an educator atSouthern Illinois University where she was very respected and loved.
