Well no it is not a movie about lawn bowls and featuring Mick Molloyand other Australian actors, this is the British comedy of years goneby with Tom Walls and his typical farce and comedic stylisings. I havebegan watching Tom Walls comedies, in a race of filmographies with mybrother and this is the third Walls comedy I have seen. This seems tobe by far the best of them, and he appears to have honed his style. Thebeginning is especially memorable with the theft of diamonds and theswitching of these around. The movie is very amusing and is well worththe watch, it is not an outstanding movie, and I am not as dedicated toTom Walls as my brother is, but his movies are usually diverting andnot terrible. This film is well worth a watch and is Tom Walls, watchthis film to get a real understanding of the Walls filmography.
