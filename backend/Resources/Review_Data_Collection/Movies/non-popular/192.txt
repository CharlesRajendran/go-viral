Rise and fall of a gambler based on the life of ArnoldRothsteinfrom a book by his former wife. Episodic and not particularlyinteresting. Some nice women\'s costumes and Alice Faye asthegirlfriend (definitely not the wife) can shake it when shegetsa chance. Spencer Tracy is on screen most of the picturebutcan\'t get past the thick layer of \'crime does no pay\' in thescript.
