Oh my God, this movie stars Joe Penny!! I thought he never did anythingapart from that horrendous cop show "Jake and the Fatman" and maybesome other cheesy TV-crap! Even in the late 70's already, he was alousy and stupid-looking actor who exclusively portrayed womanizingmacho men with limited brain capacity. And "Deathmoon" is everythingyou expect from a cheap and anonymous 70's TV-production! It's reallyboring with an incoherent plot and a complete lack of excitement! Thebasic given is perhaps original  werewolves in Hawaï  but theelaboration is truly poor and amateurish. Robert Foxworth (anotherantipathetic TV-actor) plays a overstressed businessman on vacation inHawaï, but there he transforms into a hungry werewolf and kills fellowhotel guests. Apparently the reasons for all this is that his ancestorthe missionary upset some of the aboriginals back in 1870 and theyplaced a werewolf curse upon his bloodline. Joe 'Jake' Penny plays thehunky hotel security guard who seduces stewardesses and wears idioticshirts. The wolf make-up effects are miserable and there's absolutelyno action on screen. Everyone always talks about horribly torn apartcorpses, yet we don't get to see a single drop of blood. That's justunforgivably weak, even for a TV-movie. There's too much tedious exoticdancing going on and the dialogs are dreadful! Pure crap, avoid it likethe plague.
