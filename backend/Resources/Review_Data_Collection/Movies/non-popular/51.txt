All I can say is any Warner film that has ROSS Alexander and PHIL REGANin supporting roles is already in trouble. Ross has no sparks as aleading man running away from a process server (Joan Blondell) andRegan's high-pitched tenor is hard on the ears. For comic slant we haveHUGH HERBERT in another one of his stereotyped roles to gather whateverlaughs there are from a motorboat out of control.Then we have JOAN BLONDELL and GLENDA FARRELL fast talking their waythrough an "Okay, toots" kind of script and we have more trouble aheadas the two leading ladies blunder their way through one mistake afteranother in search of good comedic results. The script is no help, withBlondell getting dumped overboard from a yacht several times in a row.Mercifully, the programmer is only 66 minutes in length, but seemslonger than that. Not recommended to anyone but die hard Joan Blondellfans who apparently think she's great in everything, no matter howridiculous the plotting is or how slim the material.
