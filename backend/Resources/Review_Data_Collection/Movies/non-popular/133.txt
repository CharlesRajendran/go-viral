I saw this Angela Mao film on a double-feature DVD, where it wasaccompanied by "Yoga And The Kung-Fu Girl". I expected the former to bethe better of the two, but boy was I wrong! "Moonlight Sword And JadeLion" is one of the most badly made films I've seen in a LONG time. Istopped following the plot about 30 minutes in, and from that point onI had no idea what was going on, nor did I care. According to IMDb,this is the ONLY film that "screenwriter" Ren Chung ever worked on, andthank God for that! You might think that the fight scenes couldpossibly redeem the picture, but they don't: they range from theforgettable to the ridiculous (a lot of the characters seem to haveunexplained superhuman abilities). Another disappointment is thatAngela Mao does about 95% of her fighting with a spear. Still, herextreme beauty is the only reason this film escapes the lowest possiblerating.
