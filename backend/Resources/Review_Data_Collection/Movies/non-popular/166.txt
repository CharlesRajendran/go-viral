This movie is truly awful. The dialogue and events are ploddingclichés. I will watch just about anything - I am not picky. But I'veseen better stories written by 14-year- olds.Even Harlequin Romance would not have bought this dreck on their worstday. Great actors Garson and Andrews were given nothing to work withhere. There was no logic for Andrews random cliché barking love/hateattitudes towards the entirely passive female played by Garson. We keptexpecting the "forced kiss to put her in her place" trope. We kept watching in hopes the movie would get better.It didn't.EDIT: I also kept watching expecting to see a closeup of my belovedGarson's face. They never did one. Not ONE. That's when I realized shemust have been deemed "old" in Hollywood's eyes. :-(
