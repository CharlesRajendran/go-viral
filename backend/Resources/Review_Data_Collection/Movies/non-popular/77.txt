Will Rogers and his family fall victim to the Great Depression and head offto California.Along the way,he encounters other travelers,and the man whowas famous for the statement"I never met a man I didn\'t like" shows that hewas apparently only referring to people who were born in America.There is avery uncomfortable  scene with a man named Cohen(Harry Green),and anotherwith an Indian,which is thankfully short,perhaps due to the fact Mr. Rogerswas half-Cherokee himself.Call this review revisionist history if youwant,but I call them like I see them.Different times,I guess.
