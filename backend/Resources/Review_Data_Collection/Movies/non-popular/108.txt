Some ingenious but corny gags involving flying fish that look likebomber planes and electric eels that light up to spell out warningmessages play a huge part in the success of PORKY'S POOR FISH, but thepig himself is out to lunch.The shenanigans of a hungry cat with his eye on the fish store sets thepace for a fast-moving B&W cartoon with a number of sight gags (allpretty corny but fun to watch). The animation is good, although onemisses seeing these sort of things in the vivid color used throughoutmost of the '40s and '50s cartoons.Not the funniest Porky the Pig, but it'll have to do--as seen on theErrol Flynn Signature Collection No.1.
