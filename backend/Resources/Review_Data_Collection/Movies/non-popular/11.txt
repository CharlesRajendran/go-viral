I am terribly sorry, I know that Fa√übinder still is called one of thegreatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films areconsidered "master-pieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! Theacting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like anidiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields areridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days inan attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to takethis for "real art", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap.Compare this to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that"Lili Marleen" is a good movie...
