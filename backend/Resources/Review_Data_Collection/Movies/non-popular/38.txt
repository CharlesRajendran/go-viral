I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of thislow-budget movie. The most glaring absurdity was that while theAmerican inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedlysuffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, going withoutbathing, shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas, and sleeping on barefloors, and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage tosport impeccably coiffed hair. With the exception of a suitablyaustere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major, the casting and actingare simply awful. Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying asingle character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam ofpast roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean campofficers might have been forgivable, but when supposedly Russianofficers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearingre-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obviouscostume-department recycles from WWII flicks) and speaking with accentslike General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just sixkinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one.
