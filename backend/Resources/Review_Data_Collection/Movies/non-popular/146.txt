SATYAM SHIVAM SUNDARAM features Zeenat Aman\'s most compelling performance.Stripped of the usual glamour girltrappings, Zeenat\'s heartfelt portrayal of Roopa (the village girl -scarredby a tragic accident & scorned by society)is simply radiant. To my ears, the soundtrack also displays musicaldirectors Laxmikant-Pyarelal and the legendarysinger Lata Mangeshkar, at their zenith. Despite the structuralshortcomingslike the engineer\'s (Shasi Kapoor)pitiful powers of perception, SATYAM SHIVAM SUNDARAM remains mesmerizing.Itis classic Indian film fare withworldwide app
