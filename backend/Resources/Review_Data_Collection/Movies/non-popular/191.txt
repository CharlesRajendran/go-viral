Spencer Tracy stars as Murray Golden, a compulsive gambler who is verygood at his craft. Virginia (Helen Twelvetrees) is inexplicably in lovewith him and agrees to marry him. However, most of their marriage,Murray is gambling or running around with his floozy, Peggy (AliceFaye)...yet still Virginia loves him and listens to his many promiseshe never keeps. At one point, he promises to stop gambling when hemakes $200,000...and doesn't. Then, he amasses nearly $650,000 duringthe 1910s...and yet he doesn't quit. It's obvious Murray is hooked andcan't stop and this will end up being the case until he falls flat onhis face...which, ultimately, has to happen. You just can't winning orcheating on your wife forever, can you?There is a major problem with this film that keeps it from being areally good film. Despite good acting (after all, it stars SpencerTracy), the main character is despicable...no two ways about it. He isan amoral liar...and how can they expect the audience to care about himin the least?! To make things worse, the ending drags on WAY too long.
