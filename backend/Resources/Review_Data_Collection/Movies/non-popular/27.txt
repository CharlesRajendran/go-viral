This film was released a year after "The Wizard of Oz," and I wassurprised to hear some of that classic\'s music being utilized in ascene here. The music in question from "Oz" is played over the openingscenes of Dorothy and Toto (puzzlingly entitled "Trouble In School"),and several times throughout the film. In "Lady with Red Hair," thesame music is heard in scenes involving the lead character\'s youngchild.Interestingly, in 1951, the film "Too Young to Kiss" utilized the exactsame music over the opening credits.Being that 1939\'s "Oz" came first, I can only assume the later films"borrowed" composer Harold Arlen\'s score.CORRECTION: I have been informed that the above-mentioned tune isactually not original to "Oz," but is a classically composed children\'stune.
