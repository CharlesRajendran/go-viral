The edges of this movie are tolerable. You have some fine, easilyrecognized actors doing some amusing bits, including Charles Laughton,Hugh Herbert, and George Chandler. The characters in the boardinghouse, eccentric misfits, are sweet and amusing.The problem is the center of the movie. Why would anybody put DorothyLamour, one of the sexiest and most beautiful women in the world in1948, in a movie where her leading man is a priest? Lamour is strippedof all sexiness and there's not a hint of desire in any of her sceneswith George Montgomery (Rev. Tom Walker). The only emotions that she'sallowed to display next to the priest is some nostalgia for theiryouthful friendship and a bit of anger that he doesn't help her to saveher uncle's boarding house.What should have been the center of the movie, Lamour seducing the newpriest from his vows, gets sublimated into the priest trying to decideif he can be as good a priest as his dead father.The movie is simply annoying most of the time. The sets, costumes,direction and editing are on the level of a bad, cheap, 1950'stelevision episode. I kept checking how much time was left every fiveminutes.George Montgomery, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Laughton fans might wantto sit through it for the sake of cinematic completeness. Everyone elsewill have a difficult time making it to the end.
