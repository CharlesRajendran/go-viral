I'm a huge fan of Pal's Puppetoons - they remain some of the mostoutstanding examples of animated films ever made. But this later workappears to have been done mainly to make amends for Pal's series of"Jasper" films, which feature such strong racial stereotypes it isimpossible to show them on television today."John Henry," while presenting African-Americans in a more favorablelight, displays little of the inventiveness and style of Pal's earlierworks. Perhaps concerns about being offensive limited his artisticchoices. Whatever the reason, this is not one of his better works.Check out his earlier films, made in Holland and England, forextraordinary flashes of brilliance.
