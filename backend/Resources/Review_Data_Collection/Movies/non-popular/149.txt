This is really a film about an unhappy woman,the people around her andher journey to find happiness. The other characters are props but propsdevised with imagination and played quite well. She has been sent toreformatory time and again and her attempts to find sexual lovefrustrated at every attempt. We feel for her and sense that she is agood human being who has simply not seen a break. In flashback we seethe reason for her unhappiness - an abusive, unsympathetic mother,people willing to exploit her...There is little of anything we have come to associate with the olderBergman. The camera movements are in Hollywood-style and the editinginvisible. The girl's desolation is mainly private, even from theviewer, but the film is one about her and not the other characters.This is one of Bergman's central points throughout his career. I'm gladI saw this but now it's time to move on.Curtis Stotlar
