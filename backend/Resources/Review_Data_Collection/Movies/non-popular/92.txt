Black Sheep (1935) ** (out of 4) A professional gambler (Edmund Lowe) and a dancer (Claire Trevor) meeton a cruise ship and decide to pull a sting against a money hungrywidow and a Texas oilman. This film has been pretty much forgotten overthe years but it had a good reputation so I gave it a shot but itreally didn't work for me. I've never been a fan of Lowe, who I findpretty dull as an actor but Trevor did manage to get a few nice laughs.The subplot dealing with Lowe's son was forced and wasn't believablewhile the actual sting is also quite boring and director Allan Dwannever manages any excitement.
