The first reviewer has done a fine job of summarizing the film. Whatremains to be said, however, is that the film is a stinker. The scriptis particularly awful. It was designed to appeal to small town folks,apparently, and focuses upon homey matters such as the loss of aboarding house by a wicked businessman. Lamour and Montgomery are sowholesome and giggly you want to wretch. Christians are, as usual, castas bigoted and gossipy. But how about Charles Laughton as a bishop.(What church? Methodist?) Hugh Herbert is completely wasted. The jokesare extremely lame. And 34-year-old Dorothy as a top high fashion modelin New York is, well, ridiculous. George Montgomery should have stuckwith Westerns, although he does his very best with his lame lines. Acompany on e-Bay is selling this film right now, which is how I came tosee it. Money totally wasted.
