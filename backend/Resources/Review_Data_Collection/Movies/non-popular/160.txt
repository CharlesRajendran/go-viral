Wayne Rogers is just a living doll. He was beyond sexy in this mostmemorable film about a handsome,exciting,young daredevil. AdrianeBarbeau was so good playing his most- unhappy wife...but in theend....after all of those women who wanted him so badly...She got herhusband back,no thanks to Elke sommers....and the darling girlfriend ofSonny Bono...The Plot is quite simple yet so many emotions are set inmotion in this Resort town in New York..I think this Ski Resort was thescene from one of the Winter Olympics? It is just so weird about SonnyBono,after all he wasn\'t in that many movies and yet he played a Skiingexpert and ironically its the way he died!. Well if you like a simpleplot but yet manges to offer plenty of fun and and a few steamyscenes...well watch this movie "Top of the Hill"...you\'ll be glad youdid!
