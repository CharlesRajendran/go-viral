Death Moon (1978) is an awful movie that is boring and a tedious watch.I had the unfortunate opportunity was actually renting this garbage awhile back. The videotape cover tricked me. It promised me a straightforward horror flick. All I got was a snooze fest of a television moviethat was the same tired old tripe. I thought I saw some bad productionsin the past but this has to rank with the worst of the bunch.A dude is vacationing in Hawaii (I guess that\'s where they spent thebudget) and is troubled by the natives. He infuriates them with hispresence. One night he wakes up and discovers he\'s been cursed. By whomor what we don\'t know. If you want to find out why or what he\'s cursedwith (one is appearing in this stupid movie) you\'ll have to go to yourlocal independent video store and find out for yourself. Be warned thismovie stinks on ice.Not recommended. It\'ll neither please werewolf fans or bad movielovers.
