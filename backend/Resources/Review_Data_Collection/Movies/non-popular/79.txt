On the opposite side of the disc for 3 Bad Men, I figured it was shortand I might as well cross it off my John Ford list. Not worth the time.The story here is just boring, and, though it's interesting to seeVictor McLaglen in a silent role and John Wayne as an extra (this washis first film appearance, and that's probably what the film is bestknown for), it's one of Ford's worst. McLaglen is supposedly the star,but he's mostly a side character. The main story revolves around a lovetriangle. June Collyer is the daughter of a notorious judge whosentenced many people to the gallows. Her father insists she marry arich man (Earle Foxe) to ward off his bad reputation, but she's in lovewith Larry Kent. McLaglen plays a mysterious figure from Foxe's pastwho shows up to expose his own evil history. Wayne appears as aspectator at a horse race who gets so excited he breaks the fence infront of him. I admit I fell asleep about ten minutes before the end ofthis one but wasn't interested enough to go back and finish it.
