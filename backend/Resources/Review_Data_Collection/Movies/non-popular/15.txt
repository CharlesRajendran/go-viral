This 2-reeler from the legendary Hal Roach Studios is, honestly, notthat great. But it is great fun to seek out those elements in the filmthat can be thought of as belonging to the modus operandi of Roachfilms in general, and Laurel and Hardy films in specific (L&H of coursemade all their classics at Hal Roach).For example, every sound film Laurel and Hardy made at Roach has, asits soundtrack, selections from a small group of humorous, tinnysounding melodies played by a small brass and string ensemble. Theexact same tunes show up in every single L&H movie. Here, the openingcredit music and closing music are the same tune, taken from this verycollection.The most notable character in "Benny, from Panama", is the great ArthurHousman, playing the drunk husband who lives on the floor below thatupon which most of the action takes place. Housman spent his entirecareer playing drunks, for me most memorably in the classic L&H short"The Fixer-Uppers". Other recognizable elements include (1) an enormous Oliver Hardy-sizedfall into a bathtub; (2) bizarre physical deformation humor (aliterally throbbing big toe that expands and shrinks like a balloon);(3) people walking into walls randomly, and so on, pretty much with theexact pacing and sounds and facial reactions that you would find in anyLaurel and Hardy movie.Of course, this is not accidental. This short was directed by JamesParrott, who directed a huge number of L&H shorts, silent and sound,and so it is not surprising that there are so many similarities. Yetthese elements are fun to look for. Otherwise, other than a fewslapstick gags, "Benny from Panama" is not particularly funny, and theexperimental use of a cartoon mosquito to pester and dive-bomb thelarge crowds of people inside the main room is, though interesting, notreally effective effective.
