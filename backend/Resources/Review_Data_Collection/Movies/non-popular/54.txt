A VERY un-Tom and Jerry short. Jerry narrates this tale that revolvesaround Tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival, Butch.Tom is best friends with Jerry here which irked me a bit. The cartoonis also presented in Cinemascope. Overall I found this Tom and Jerrycartoon sad and depressing. The should have just put "Puss gets theboot" on the DVD instead and I would\'ve been happy. This experimentalanimated short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother\'s 2-DVDSpotlight Collection set. It\'s the last one on the set and I\'m hopingthat Warner Brothers chooses to release a second Volume soon.My Grade: C-
