What I've read about Ken Maynard on IMDb and wikipedia makes it soundlike he was a real jerk. Rarely have I read biographies of actors wherethey were more hated and more self-destructive than this movie cowboy.Heck in the IMDb biography, it says 'To never have met Maynard wasreportedly a blessing'!! But, because he was so unpleasant he ended upgoing from an A-list actor with a huge salary in 1935 to a bum whoworked for a tiny fraction only a few short years later. Here in "DeathRides the Range", instead of being in a top picture for a top studio(commanding $10,000 a picture), he's in a film that cost only $15,000to make and he was paid a reported $1500. Talk about karma! It did getworse--by the mid-1940s he was getting only $800 a film....if he couldfind work at all.So is it possible to make a good film for only $15,000? Maybe, thoughthis film would make it seem that the answer is a definite NO! Theproblems are many--and the worst is the quality of the supportingcharacters. Several seem illiterate and a little addle-brained in frontof the camera and it just looks like the tiny studio would put any onein the film provided they didn't want much money!! Rarely (and thisincludes Ed Wood movies) have I seen such bad acting. Additionally, theterrible writing didn't help. While the basic story idea isinteresting, how it was handled was just completely inept. All in all,a very bad film--one that I had a hard time completing.
