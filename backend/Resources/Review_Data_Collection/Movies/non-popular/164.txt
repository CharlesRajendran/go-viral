Secret Agent (1943) ** (out of 4)Seventeenth and final short in Paramount's series once again deals withWW2 issues as Clark Kent helps a female secret agent and allows himselfto get kidnapped so that he can learn Nazi secrets. For the lastSuperman short they really decided to pretty much take him out ofeverything considering he has only one line of dialogue and doesn'tshow up until the final minute or two of the film. In reality this is apretty straight WW2 action film as for the majority of the time we havethe saboteurs constantly after the female secret agent and of coursecoming up just short. Once again we get some rather nice animation butall of that is lost with the rather weak story that never really paysoff.
