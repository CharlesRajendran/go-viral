Louie is in desperate need of $300 and if he doesn't come up with it hewill lose his ice cream shop. The boys try to raise the money byselling their old jalopy and when that doesn't work out, Slip decidesto try and get a bank loan. Outside the bank, the boys meet theirfriend Cathy Smith who is a street photographer. Sach begs Cathy totake his photo and just as she snaps the picture, bank robber rush out.Cathy's photo shows Sach holding the bag of loot. First the boys try toget the photo back but that fails and Sach's photo appears on the frontpage of the newspaper and now the cops are hot on Sach's trail. Theyfind out that the gangster Ace Deuce Baker is behind the theft and thathe has planted thousand dollar bills on Sach to ensure that he'll takethe fall for the robbery. To infiltrate Ace's night club lair, Slipdecides to impersonate a notorious gangster with the boys, sans Sach,pretending to be his henchmen. For me, the lengthy scene at thenightclub fell flat. While mildly amusing, it just wasn't very funny.And the whole bit with Professor Scrackenberger and his experiment with"drinkable" explosives was too dumb even for a Bowery Boys movie. Thereare a few funny moments (such as Slip's comment that Sach is so dumbhe's probably going around bragging about having his picture in thepaper) and the supporting cast, especially Sheldon Leonard, TealaLoring (an actress I never recall seeing in any other movie) and JamesBurke do a good job. The same year Leonard did this role of Ace he alsoappeared in 'It's a Wonderful Life.' Uh, my guess is he's betterremembered for the later role.
