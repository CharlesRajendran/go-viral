Lumber Jerks (1955) * 1/2 (out of 4) Twin gophers are collecting nuts to move into their new home (a tree)when lumber jacks tear it down and move it down the river to turn intofurniture. Freleng and Blanc were masters of animation but this here isone of their duds. I really can't say too many goods things about thisshort and the more I think of it the less I like it. For starters,found a lot of the animation to be mediocre at best. Nothing isdownright bad but at the same time nothing really jumps off the screensaying it's good. I was also rather disappointed in the vocals becausethey're more annoying than anything else. I'm sure the heart of thefilmmakers were in the right place but the end results are prettylacking.
