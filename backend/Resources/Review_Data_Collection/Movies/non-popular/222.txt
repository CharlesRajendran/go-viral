If you're thinking you'll be getting those lovable rogues from ButchCassidy And The Sundance Kid in Wyoming Renegades you'd be dead wrong.This Hole In The Wall gang features a mean, but very crafty ButchCassidy in Gene Evans and a charming, but deadly Sundance Kid inWilliam Bishop.I will say that Evans and Bishop don't end up in Bolivia but they docome to justice in Wyoming Renegades. And it's all because they won'tlet gang member Philip Carey just go his own way.Carey returns to his home town and just wants to open the familyblacksmith business again after his stretch in prison. But except forthe girl he left behind Martha Hyer and a stranger in town DouglasKennedy no one wants him. When Evans and Bishop try to pull a holdup ofthe bank then they really don't want him.Without name stars this western has a nice ring of authenticity eventhough the plot is totally made up. I liked how Gene Evans playedCassidy, he's one crafty villain and nobody's fool.As for how he's gotten, all I'll say is there was one person that Evansnever figured on for outsmarting him.
