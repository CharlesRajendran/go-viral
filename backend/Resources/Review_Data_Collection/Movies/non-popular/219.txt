"Hit Parade of 1943" was later re-titled "Change of Heart", thoughchanging the title did nothing to improve this second-rate bit offluff. Although it stars Susan Hayward, this was before she became atop star and the film is clearly a case of her slumming it at RepublicStudios. Her co-star is the equally non-famous John Carroll--who, asusual, plays a bit of a slime-ball.Hayward plays a song writer who is supposed to be quite smart and atough cookie as well. So, when she meets up with a slimy song writer(Carroll) and he steals her music, you assume she'll make sure to gether revenge. So far, so good. However, soon she falls in love with himand all is forgiven--although he's clearly a jerk who's made a careerout of stealing other people's work! I HATE films that featuresupposedly smart women acting like total idiots--and that certainly isthe case here. What will happen with this budding love--especially whenCarroll's OTHER woman makes an appearance? Who cares.The only thing about this film that is worth seeing is the big musicalnumber featuring some top Black entertainers of the era--includingCount Basie and a young Dorothy Dandridge. The plot, in contrast, is acomplete mess--and never comes close to being engaging or believable inany manner. A bad film redeemed, very slightly, by the music.
