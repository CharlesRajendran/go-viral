Today Spencer Tracy is looked upon as a sage contemplative man ofwisdom in regards to his film persona as husband, father and priestover the decades. In the Show -Off Tracy becomes one of the manycharacters that would try his calm patience in the years to come.J. Aubrey Piper is a lowly railroad office employee who freely givesvent to all who will listen or are in ear shot to his delusions ofgrandeur. After inadvertently becoming a hero by falling off a boat tosave a drowning man he hooks up with Amy Fisher (Madge Evans) whobelieves in him even if her family (and you can't blame them) doesn't.J. Aubrey continues to make a mess of things though and loses his joband Amy leaves him while J A is now reduced to wearing a sandwich boardadvertising turkey dinners. Tracy's Piper possesses a huge ego that fails to see the error of hisways in the most glaring of circumstances. He's so abrasive, annoyingand audacious at times that you just want someone to slap some senseinto him. Spence goes a little over the top at times but it's whenchastened and free of mania that we see the performer that would go onto be as respected as any film actor of his era bring the audience tohis side. The prolific Clara Blandick (she'd appear in 10 films in1934) as the disapproving mother provides a perfect foil for Piper withcutting one liners and withering facial expressions.Overall The Show-Off is a mild comedy with a thin story line but itdoes offer an energetic performance from Spencer Tracy seldom seen in aman with the cinema gravitas of Mount Rushmore.
