The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I haveloved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. Ilove all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and CurlyJoe)! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other greatactors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! InMy opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and isthe all time funniest comedy team! This is a great Three Stooges short and it has become one of Myfavorites! I just love it when Joe Palma talks to Cy Schindell and saysabout the corpse moving and Schindell says something like sure if he\'dhave wings he\'d fly away, maybe I should ask if he is dead and Curlyreplies and Schindell says to Palma that see he told you himself thathe was dead and then they realize what has just happened. Itshilarious! Great one from beginning to end!
