House of Darkness, The (1913) *** (out of 4) Interesting D.W. Griffith short about the mentally ill and how music"helps them". The film is very well made with Lionel Barrymore giving avery good performance but Griffith goes way too over the top in themelodrama to make this a total victory. Lillian Gish has a small role.You can find this short on Image's Griffith disc but sadly a lot of thedirector's films still aren't on DVD. It's too bad a studio doesn'tstart releasing yearly sets. Griffith is the most important name infilm history and all of his films need to be out there.
