This movie seems to be pulling in so many different directions at oncethat it's difficult to figure out exactly what the filmmakers wereactually trying to achieve. Was this intended to be a science- fictionthriller, a political comment on totalitarianism, a comedy or perhapsall three at once? It certainly seems to be a bit of all three atvarious times, and sometimes all three at the same time. Perhaps it isfor that reason that the cumulative effect is a bit bizarre and doesn'tquite work. For example, if this movie wasn't intended to be a comedythen why did they cast Paul Douglas and Leslie Phillips, both of whomwere known principally for playing comic parts, in the two lead roles?And why do the police who administer the supposed Police State in themovie go about dressed in comic opera uniforms and seem no moreformidable than the proverbial "Keystone Kops"? Even the head of thepolice comes off as such a hopeless buffoon that it is impossible tofeel the least bit intimidated by him. One gets the impression that thecountry in the film was supposed to represent a sort of miniature NaziGermany or Stalinist Soviet Union, but it simply comes off as aslightly bonkers version of San Marino or Andorra, complete with theobligatory colorful folkways.See this if you have never seen it, just for the experience of a filmthat is so truly strange that it is almost impossible to categorizeunder any single genre.
