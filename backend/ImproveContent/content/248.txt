Based on Mark Twain's novel, 'The Millionaire Pound Note' takes aninteresting satirical look at the hypocrisy stemming from classdistinction in the 50s England. England is a country where class andwealth are given extreme significance, especially among the rich. Thefilm shows the hypocrisy that existed among these people, how the richare quick to change face when in an instant they find out that you're aman of wealth and how within the next moment they revert back to theircondescending selves when all wealth is lost. Interestingly, 'TheMillionaire' also briefly looks at how the English perceived Americansin that era. Rich Americans were welcomed as outsiders and the poorwere quickly shunned away. The fact that he's an outsider either makeshim more appealing or the complete opposite. The story sticks to themain theme by emphasizing on the hypocrisy of the upper class societybut at the same time it also creates a balance that prevents the moviefrom being a mockery of the British society. The movie drags at somepoint but the love story appears at the right time and there is plentyof comedy to keep one entertained. A charming Gregory Peck totallynails the part and the luminous Jane Griffiths is a treat. ReginaldBeckwith, as Peck's sidekick Rock is amusing. The ending is a littlepredictable but the director does an overall good job by rounding it upand presenting his points.
