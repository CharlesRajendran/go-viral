The Million Pound Note finds its way into the hands of a pennilessAmerican sailor who hasn't a pence to his name as he arrives in theUnited Kingdom at the turn of the last century. Gregory Peck who playsthe sailor by chance runs into two elderly English brothers, RonaldSquires and Wilfrid Hyde-White, both filthy rich and are having anacademic discussion around money.They give Peck a million pound note from the Bank of England and theidea is to present himself as an eccentric American millionaire and forone month live off the reputation of that note. Peck's not to pay oneshilling or break the note in any way. He's to live strictly on creditfor that month, live I might add in a posh London hotel, typically poshfor the 1900 or so.Before I watched The Million Pound Note tonight I saw a variation onthe same theme in Pretty Woman. Julia Roberts goes to a chic RodeoDrive store in Beverly Hills and the first time arriving in her hookerworking clothes, she's shown the door, but quick. But as Richard Geresaid to her, they don't respect people, but credit cards yes, thehigher the spending limit, the better.The Million Pound Note was Gregory Peck's first venture into comedy andif you're looking for a lot of gags and belly laughs, skip this film.What you will find is a nice piece of whimsical humor where Peck'sessential decency is kind of turned on itself for laughs. He'sperfectly willing to be an guinea pig as the two old gents will givehim enough money to get back to America.But in this as in so many films, Peck doesn't count on falling in lovewith young aristocrat Jane Griffiths. She doesn't mind him beingpenniless or so she tells him, but snooty aunt Joyce Grenfell sure doeswhen word comes out Peck's a fake.The Million Pound Note is a good film with Peck in a perfectly suitedcharacter for himself. And it proves the old adage that millionairesare eccentric and paupers are just crazy.
