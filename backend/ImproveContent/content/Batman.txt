1. This movie is almost 3 hours long. Out of this 3 hours Batman was sick and crippled 2 hours. He was in his batman suit and did his batman stuff 15 minutes.

2. I could not understand 80% of what Bane was saying.

3. There are A LOT of long, boring, brainwashing , clich√© dialogs.

4. Gotham painfully reminded me of LA and NY. I mean really painfully.

5. Throughout the movie i had a feeling that i was watching some stupid piece of propaganda how wonderful all super rich people are and how dumb are the rest of us. That orphanage in Bruce's house almost made me puke.

Catwoman was rather enjoyable character.

This movie, or should i rather say this propaganda piece would appeal to a people with very low IQ and some really die hard Batman fans.
