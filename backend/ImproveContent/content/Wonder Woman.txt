This film was definitely worthy of being the first time Wonder Woman was given her own movie. Stunning visuals with a color palate that blends well with the DCEU, this film will be known as the film where DC turned its movie franchises around. Gal Gadot gives a truly believable and relatable performance as Wonder Woman, portraying her with both naivety and strength all the while kicking butt and leading the fight against Ares, God of War. In the future, this movie will surely be considered a classic amongst the superhero genre and I am looking forward to seeing more of Princess Diana of Themyscira.
