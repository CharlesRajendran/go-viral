I may sound different than other reviewers ,but Bahubali 2 has shattered all my hopes . The story can be anything but epic . The plot is highly predictable, clich√©d and sloppy to say the least . It reminded me the movies from 80's and early 90's where everything used to be stereotyped ,be it the story, narratives or screenplay. Instead of giving more emphasis on a proper conclusion ,its more about showing the facts/reasons behind Kattappa killing Bahubali. When one speaks about the word revenge , one must highlight how the revenge is taken. The focus should be on devising the plans and the execution process . In the second part of the magnum opus the story revolves around bahubali,kattappa and devsena.The characters of bhallaldeva(main antagonist),shivgami play second fiddle in the movie .We get to see a prolonged storyline of the romance between prabhas & anushka,unnecessary average songs and a lot of hullabaloo involving the war sequence. The weakest part of the story is the fact that its highly predictable.The writer could have used a few twist and turns to make the plot more intriguing.The climax is disappointing .One would expect a proper face off between bhallaldeva and bahubali.However it appears that the makers were in a hurry to wrap up the movie in the limited amount of screen timing. The only notable praiseworthy factors about the movie are the graphics and special effects . The director has put a significant amount of effort for the grandeur of the project. However he could have chosen a better way of storytelling and mostly a mature plot ,given the gargantuan effort (in terms of time and money) involved with the film .
